OWINFS’s founding statement is “<a href="no-new-round">No New Round – Turn Around</a>.” This is an international statement written in advance of the 1999 WTO Ministerial in Seattle — calling on WTO member-nations to reject expansion or a “new round”—and, instead, to roll-back harmful WTO provisions and policies. This statement was signed by nearly 1500 organizations in the run-up to the Ministerial.
<p>
Our second statement was “<a href="shrink-or-sink">Our World is not for Sale: WTO – Shrink or Sink!</a>” This international “sign-on” statement, prepared after the Seattle Ministerial, lays out eleven transformational demands aimed at the WTO. Active OWINFS members have signed onto the statement.

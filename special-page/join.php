OWINFS welcomes organizations with similar goals and activities to become members! To become a member of OWINFS, we ask that organizations first endorse our <a href="statement-political-unity">Statement of Political Unity</a>. Then just <a href="mailto:djames@cepr.net">email OWINFS </a> a one page description of your work, your membership base, and why you would like to become a member of OWINFS. Organizations should include a current OWINFS member as a reference.</p>Then, we circulate this document to our members and if there are no objections, after two weeks, you become a member! This allows you to be on our confidential information and strategizing listservs and participate in the network. We look forward to working with you!

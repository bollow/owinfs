The OWINFS statement, “WTO Turnaround: Food, Jobs and Sustainable Development First - Call to Action!, first developed in 2011 and <a href="http://ourworldisnotforsale.net/2013/OWINFS_WTO_stmt.pdf">updated in 2013</a>, details the demands of global civil society for fundamental changes to the multilateral trading system, from one that privileges the “rights” of capital while restricting governmental regulation in the public interest, to one that enables countries to use trade for sustainable development, while disciplining corporate behavior in countries around the world. 
<p>
OWINFS also has a <a href="statement-political-unity">Statement of Political Unity</a> that brings together our critiques of the WTO with our visions for a more fair and sustainable multilateral trade organization. We spell out our arguments against the unfair rules in the WTO, such as on agriculture and protectionism of the holders of intellectual property, along with critiques of liberalization of goods, services, investment, and other aspects of human life. Our critique is fundamentally of the outsize power of corporations, and the “neoliberal” model of economics which redistribute income and wealth from people who work to holders of capital, as well as of the exploitation of the global South by the North. We also put forth What We Stand For: Asserting People’s Right to Choose: Self-determination, Democracy and Development; Advancing the Primacy of Social Rights and the Environment; Protecting Essential Services; Defending Knowledge, Culture and Life Forms as the Essence of Civilization; Preserving and Advancing Food Sovereignty and Food Security; and Stopping Corporate Globalization and Promoting Trade Justice. 
<p>

<p>
Previously, OWINFS had other “flagship” statements that reflected our basis of unity. The first was “No New Round – Turn Around.” This was an international statement written in advance of the 1999 WTO Ministerial in Seattle — calling on WTO member-nations to reject expansion or a “new round”—and, instead, to roll-back harmful WTO provisions and policies. This statement was signed by nearly 1500 organizations in the run-up to the Ministerial.
<p>
The second statement was “<a href="o/en/node/3">Our World is not for Sale: WTO – Shrink or Sink!</a>”. This international “sign-on” statement, prepared after the Seattle Ministerial, lays out eleven transformational demands aimed at the WTO. Active OWINFS members signed onto the statement.
In addition, OWINFS has developed specific and more detailed statements around issues such as protecting basic services, namely, “Stop the GATS Attack Now” - which can be read at http://www.gatswatch.org/StopGATS.html - and challenging the fundamental lack of democracy within the WTO.

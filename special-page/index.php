<h2><a href="TRIPS">End the Pandemic!<br>TRIPS Waiver Now!</a></h2>

<b><i><a href="2021_WTO_waiver_CTA">Global Call to Action: WTO Waiver <u>Now</u> to End the Pandemic!</a></i></b>
<p>
The global health community, civil society around the world, legislators, international agencies, former heads of state, and over 100 WTO members support the waiver on intellectual property rules on COVID-19 related treatments, diagnostics, and vaccines to end the pandemic. The TRIPS waiver can be agreed at any General Council meeting and does NOT require a Ministerial. This is the ONLY agenda that WTO Members should be focusing on at this time.

<h2>Sham “Walker Process”</h2>
Having refused for over a year to agree to the waiver that would resolve the pandemic, trade negotiators from the EU, Switzerland, Canada, the UK, and a few other countries - representing the interests of Big Pharma over their own citizens and global public health - have invented a diversionary tactic called the “<a href="https://twn.my/title2/briefing_papers/MC12/briefings/WTO%20reform%20&%20WTO%20pandemic%20response%20TWNBP%20MC12.pdf">Walker Process</a>.” Allegedly a “WTO Response to the Covid-19,” this process is designed to try to save the WTO from its increasing irrelevance and illegitimacy, by drawing attention away from the WTO’s failure to remove the <a href="https://www.twn.my/title2/intellectual_property/trips_waiver_proposal.htm">barriers of its Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rules (TRIPS) agreement</a> to resolving the pandemic.

<h2><a href="fish">Fisheries</a></h2>
WTO members are working to finalize new disciplines on Fisheries Subsidies at MC12. However, many members, abetted by the WTO Director-General, are trying to ensure that these exclude development considerations which are part of the mandate. Developing countries - which have not contributed to the global collapse in fish stocks - need fisheries for their livelihoods and for food security.

<h2>Stop WTO Expansion!</h2>
Pro-corporate governments at the WTO are attempting to pursue a failed agenda of WTO expansion. Developed countries are attempting to undermine the core fundamentals of the WTO's mandate as a multilateral institution and alter decision-making procedures by using MC12 to normalize the “Joint Statement Initiatives (JSIs)” launched at the Buenos Aires Ministerial and henceforward.

<a href="/2021/Kelsey_JSI_legitimacy_ES.pdf">Resumen en español</a>.
<p>
The JSI on <a href="services">domestic regulation</a> is finalized.
The JSI on <a href="investment">investment facilitation</a> is nearly finalized.
The JSI on <a href="digital">digital trade</a> (a.k.a. “e-commerce”) is still under negotiation. 
<p>
In addition, there are JSIs on <a href="https://www.twn.my/title2/wto.info/2021/ti211118.htm">environmental issues</a> and on <a href="2017/Feminist_stmt.pdf">gender and the WTO</a>. Rather than being progressive calls for putting planetary sustainability or gender equity above commercial interests, these declarations are attempts to push a failed liberalization agenda — “old wine in new bottles”.

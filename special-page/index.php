<h1><a href="MC13">13<sup>th</sup> Ministerial Conference</a></h1>
The 13th Ministerial Conference of the WTO is scheduled to take place
26-29 February 2024 in Abu Dhabi.

<h2><a href="digital">Digital trade</a></h2>
<p>
Before digital trade was a significant aspect of global trade, members of the WTO agreed to a “moratorium” on customs duties on electronic transmissions. It’s high time for this tax holiday for Big Tech to come to an end. Countries should have the right to decide if taxing Amazon e-books, Netflix movies, Apple music, Microsoft software, or video games is in their national interest, as these foreign operators compete tariff-free against domestic small and medium business competitors. WTO members should allow the moratorium to lapse, rather than be renewed, at MC13.
<p>
Some countries are pushing for anti-development, anti-public interest and pro-Big Tech rules in the WTO under the guise of “e&#8209;commerce.”

<h2><a href="agriculture">Food & agriculture</a></h2>
<p>
Countries should have the right to support the production of food that is consumed domestically. WTO members agreed to find a permanent solution to the public stockholding programs by December 2017. At MC13, WTO members should deliver a positive resolution on the public stockholding issue that allows all developing countries to implement food security programs without onerous restrictions that are not demanded of developed countries’ trade distorting subsidies.

<h2><a href="TRIPS">Access to Medicines</a></h2>
<p>
It is outrageous that some rich countries blocked the approval of a waiver of TRIPS patent monopolies that restricted developing countries’ access to vaccines, diagnostics, and treatments throughout the Covid-19 pandemic and to today.

<h2>Stop WTO Expansion!</h2>
Pro-corporate governments at the WTO are attempting to pursue a failed agenda of WTO expansion. Developed countries are attempting to undermine the core fundamentals of the WTO's mandate as a multilateral institution and alter decision-making procedures by using “Joint Statement Initiatives (JSIs)” launched at the Buenos Aires Ministerial and henceforward. 


<h2><a href="climate">Trade &amp; Environment</a></h2>
<p>
MC13 will feature discussions on “trade and the environment,” in which the largest polluters will use sustainability rhetoric to try to gain market access in developing countries and leave multilateral principles behind, while blocking progress on developing countries’ solutions for climate adaption focused on green technology transfer rights.

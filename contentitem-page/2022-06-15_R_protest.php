Geneva, Switzerland -- Today, a group of civil society working together through the global Our World Is Not for Sale (OWINFS) network, performed a die-in protest to condemn delay and destruction of the TRIPS waiver, which would temporarily waive intellectual property monopoly barriers blocking the production of COVID-19 vaccines tests and treatments around the world. One by one, activists “died” as they explained how the European Union, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States have chipped away at a meaningful waiver, leading to ongoing deaths around the world.

Over 50 civil society experts – trade unionists, farmers, development advocates, and consumer activists – from more than 23 countries have traveled to Geneva for the 12th Ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization (WTO) as part of the global Our World Is Not For Sale (OWINFS) network. Civil society delegates are at the WTO from: India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines, Pacific Islands, Ghana, Liberia, Malawi, Morocco, South Africa, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, USA, Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and the UK.
<p>
Groups put an NGO statement on the WTO decision to retract their previously granted access to the Ministerial Conference on its opening day on 12 June 2022. Their press conference on 12 June can be viewed here. And a media availability list of NGO experts, many of whom are in Geneva for MC12, is available here. These and many other documents of analysis by CSOs are available here: <a href="https://ourworldisnotforsale.net/MC12">https://ourworldisnotforsale.net/MC12</a>.
<p>
On the TRIPS waiver on intellectual property rules to save lives during the Covid pandemic, civil society leaders urged countries to reject the counter-proposal DG text with its onerous new TRIPS+ provisions which would actually add new obligations to TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) on developing countries rather than save lives.
<p>
They also demanded a permanent solution to public stockholding, so that developing countries can achieve food security through increased production. They urged delegates to reject the anti-development fisheries text that is on the table, and to start again with a pro-development proposals. And they condemned the Green Room tactics and false promise of “WTO Reform” which is actually a developed country agenda to abandon multilateralism, consensus, and development architecture of the WTO.

<h2>Chants from Demonstrators:</h2>

It’s 2022<br>
The third year of the pandemic<br>
And still no affordable access<br>
To vaccines, treatments and tests<br>
As common public goods.
<p>
And at WTO<br>
Still no TRIPS waiver<br>
The fake waiver on the table<br>
Fulfilling big pharma’s dreams<br>
Is not what the world needs<br>
<p>
The EU has been blocking<br>
The real waiver<br>
That India and South Africa proposed<br>
And over 60 countries cosponsored.
<p>
The UK and Switzerland<br>
Are making the bad text even worse
<p>
The United States<br>
Said it supports the waiver<br>
But has done NOTHING to achieve it. 
<p>
Those who delayed<br>
And watered down the waiver<br>
Have blood on their hands
<p>
*Demonstrator dies*
<p>
A real TRIPS waiver<br>
Covers vaccines, treatments and diagnostics<br>
Covers all forms of IP
<p>
*Demonstrator dies*
<p>
No TRIPS+ conditions<br>
No necessity tests<br>
No notification requirements<br>
No countries excluded<br>
Allow all re-exports<br>
Let non-WTO members benefit<br>
10 years is the minimum
<p>
*Demonstrator dies*
<p>
WTO members:<br>
Stand up to pharma!<br>
And walk away!<br>
Walk away!<br>
From the DG’s text<br>
It’s not a real waiver.
<p>
*Demonstrator dies*
<p>
COVID is not over<br>
It continues to kill.<br>
It continues to mutate.<br>
While big pharma profits.<br>
<p>
*Demonstrator dies*
<p>
People in the North<br>
Have had multiple shots<br>
And can get treatments
<p>
But in the South<br>
COVID is likely<br>
To be a death sentence.
<p>
*Demonstrator dies*
<p>
It’s 2022<br>
The third year of the pandemic<br>
And still no affordable access<br>
To vaccines, treatments and tests<br>
As common public goods.
<p>
*Demonstrator dies*
<p>
And now a moment of silence<br>
And now a moment of silence<br>
For the ongoing deaths<br>
Caused by delay<br>
Of a real TRIPS waiver!
<p>
*Moment of silence*
<p>
Bell to end the silence

<u><b>Summary</b></u>
<p>
The present paper attempts to clarify the issue of self-determination
of the WTO status of each Member as a developed country or developing
country (DC), which has been challenged mainly by the US, followed by
the EU, against China and India. 

<p>
In her inaugural speech of 13 February 2021, the
WTO new Director General, Dr <span style="background: #ffffff">Ngozi
Okonjo-Iweala, </span>said she
wanted to take the WTO preamble seriously: &quot;<i>The
preamble of the Marrakesh Agreement states that the objectives of the
WTO are to raise living standards, ensure full employment, raise
incomes… </i><i>The WTO is about people!
It’s about decent work!</i>&quot;. And,
on  26 April 2021, she said that one of her three priorities will be
to tackle agricultural subsidies, mostly given by developed nations
including the US and the EU. It is why this paper makes its
comparisons on a per capita basis of six WTO Members: four Western
Members – USA, EU28, Canada, Japan –, China and India in 2019 and
2020, on five issues: income and wages; social performance;
environmental performance; trade performance and agricultural
support. 

<p>
On all these issues China and India are justified
to claim their developing country status. In few words: 1) the US per
capita income at PPP (purchasing power parity) was in 2019 3.6 times
higher than that of China and 9.3 times higher than that of India; 2)
t<span style="background: #ffffff">he
Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index </span>of
the US and EU was 22% larger than that of China and 44% larger than
that of India; 3) the cumulative CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions of the US was twice that of China and 8.3 times that of
India while those of the EU were 1.8 times that of China and 7.7
times that of India; 4) per capita US exports of all products were
2.4 times larger than those of China in 2020 and 21.7 larger than
those of India and per capita US food exports were 9.5 times higher
than those of China and 17.3 times higher than those of India; 5) the
total agricultural support per agricultural working unit (AWU) was
8.3 times that of China for the US and 2.3 times for the EU28, and 
it was 11.1 times that of India for the US and the 3.1 times that of
India for the EU28. 

<p>
However, this justification of China's and India's
status of developing economies should not be seen as an endorsement
of many other aspects of their policies both internally –
particularly in terms of undemocratic regimes and the persecution of
Muslims in China with Uighurs and in India since Narendra Mody –
and externally, notably the development of Chinese economic
imperialism with the Silk Roads, especially the risk of too large
indebtedness of Africa to China.

<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
The present paper attempts to clarify the issue of self-determination
of the WTO status of each Member as a developed country or developing
country (DC), which has been challenged mainly by the US, followed by
the EU, against China and India, by comparing available official data
of broad macroeconomic indicators and trade performance of six WTO
Members: four Western Members – USA, EU28, Canada, Japan –, China
and India in 2019 and 2020. 

<p>
In her inaugural speech of 13 February 2021, the
WTO new Director General, Dr <span style="background: #ffffff">Ngozi
Okonjo-Iweala, </span>said she
wanted to take the WTO preamble seriously: &quot;<i>The
preamble of the Marrakesh Agreement states that the objectives of the
WTO are to raise living standards, ensure full employment, raise
incomes, expand production and trade in goods and services, and seek
the optimal use of the world's resources in accordance with the
objective of sustainable development. </i><i>The
preamble says it all! The WTO is about people! It’s about decent
work!</i>
<i>Let's put its overarching
objective at the forefront as the driving force behind everything we
seek to achieve for the multilateral trading system… T</i><i>he
WTO’s work in new or innovative areas does not mean that
traditional topics such as agriculture are forgotten. Agriculture is
particularly important for many developing and least developing
countries. Improving market access for export products of interest to
these countries is of paramount importance, as is dealing with trade
distorting domestic support. The growing domestic support
entitlements of Members </i><i><br/>
</i><i>must
be addressed to level the playing field, so as to provide
opportunities for small </i><i><br/>
</i><i>scale
farmers</i>&quot;<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote1anc" href="#sdfootnote1sym">1</a></sup>.
And, in a videoconference organised by the European Commission on 26
April 2021), &quot;<i>Okonjo-Iweala said
that one of her three priorities for this year will be to tackle
agricultural subsidies, which are mostly given by developed nations
including the US and the EU… She said Beijing wants to see progress
on agricultural subsidies, which currently represent around €1
trillion and could double by 2030. &quot;I would like to look at
subsidies across the board” and see how “from all perspectives we
are creating a level playing field” the WTO chief said</i>&quot;<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote2anc" href="#sdfootnote2sym">2</a></sup>.
<p>
Taking Dr <span style="background: #ffffff">Ngozi
Okonjo-Iweala</span> seriously that
WTO is about people, most comparisons will be made on a per capita
basis. These analyses will cover five issues: levels of income and
wages; social performance; environment performance; trade performance
and agricultural support. On all these issues China and India are
justified to claim their developing country status. 

<p>
<u><b>I – Macro-economic indicators of the US, EU28, Japan, Canada,
China and India </b></u>

<p>
As macroeconomic indicators for the EU28 are not
available but only for the Eurozone, we use the data for the three
main countries: Germany, France, United Kingdom (UK), together with
the US, Japan, Canada, China and India. Table 1 shows that the US per
capita income at PPP (purchasing power parity) was in 2019 3.6 times
higher than that of China and 9.3 times that of India. In per capita
nominal GDP the US level was 5.8 times higher than that of China and
31.2 times that of India. And the US average wage at PPP was 3.4
times higher in 2019 than in China and 8.1 times than in India.
<p>
The percentage of US employment in agriculture (without forestry and
fishing) was 18.1 times lower than in China in 2019 and 30.4% lower
than in India (25% lower than in Nigeria).
<p>
Those economic indicators justify the developing country status of
China and India at the WTO.

The unweighted average HDI of the 6 developed countries of 0,926 in
2019 (which was also that of the US and of the three EU countries)
was 21.7% larger than that of China and 43.6% larger than that of
India. And the US IHDI was 26.4% higher than that of China and 70.1%
than that of India. In fact the US income distribution is more
unequal than those of China and India if we compare the income share
of the 1% richest and of the 40% poorest: in the US the 1% richest
gets 20.5% of national income while the 40% poorest get 15.4%, a gap
of 5.1% between the two. In China the 40% poorest get 17.2% of
national income and the 1% richest 13.9%, a gap of 3.3% between the
two. And, if in India the 1% richest gets 21.3% of national income
(more than in the US) against 18.8% for the 40% poorest, the gap
between the two is of only 2.5%. Apart from the US these indicators
are lower in the other 5 Western countries than in China and India.

<p>
Even if the US life expectancy at birth and maternal and infant
mortality rates are significantly higher than in the 3 EU countries,
Canada and Japan, they are much lower than in China and India. Again
these two sets of indicators on income and health inequalities
justify their developing country status at the WTO.     

<p>
<u><b>III – Environmental performance</b></u>
<p>
Table 3 shows first the amount and share of each
country (and EU28) in global cumulative greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions in CO<sub>2</sub>
equivalent since 1751 and then in total and from agriculture
emissions in 2019. For cumulative emissions the US 24.82% share was
twice that of China and 8.3 times that of India while the EU28 22.0%
share was 1.8 times that of China and 7.7 times that of India. 

<p>
For 2019 the US total GHG was of 49% that of China and twice that of
India and, per capita, 2.3 times that of China and 9.6 times that of
India. For the EU28 the total GHG was 35% that of China and 1.4 times
that of India and, per capita, 92% that of China and 3.8 times that
of India. For the GHG emissions of agriculture the US level was 57%
of that of China and 60% that of India but, per capita, il was 2.5
times higher than that of China and India. For the EU28 the EU
emissions were at 60% of those of China and 64% of those of India
but, per capita, they were 1,7 times higher than those of China and
India.     

<p>
Clearly on climate change China and India can claim their developing
country status.

<u><b>IV – Trade performance of the US, EU28, Japan, Canada, China
and India: 2019&amp;2020 </b></u>

<p>
Table 4 compares the exports of the main Western
countries with those of China and India in 2019 (and 2020) for total
products, food products and agricultural raw materials, and derives
them per capita. If the US total exports accounted for only 66% of
those of China in 2019 and 55% in 2020, per capita they were 2.87
times and 2.40 times larger, and if they were 5.08 times larger than
those of India in 2019 (5.19 times in 2020), per capita they were
21.11 times larger (21.65 in 2020). If the EU28 total exports
accounted for only 91.6% of those of China in 2019 (81.6% in 2020),
per capita they were 2.56 times and 2.29 times larger, and if they
were 7.08 times larger than those of India in 2019 (7.67 times in
2020), per capita they were 18,86 times larger (20.64 times in 2020).
    

<p>
If the US food exports were twice higher than those of China in 2019
(2.08 times in 2020), per capita they were 8.3 times larger (9.5
times in 2020), and if they were 4.5 times larger than those of India
in 2019 (as in 2020), per capita they were 17.0 times larger in 2019
(17.3 in 2020). If the EU28 food exports were 2.2 times higher than
those of China in 2019 (2.3 times in 2020), per capita they were 6.1
times higher in 2019 (6.5 times in 2020), and if they were 4.73 times
larger than those of India in 2019 (4.66 in 2020), per capita they
were 12.6 times larger in 2019 (12.5 times in 2020).

Table 6 on the trade balance (exports of table 4 minus imports of
table 5) shows that China is the only of the 6 countries to have a
large positive balance for all products in 2019 as for 2020 (Japan
also in 2020). On the contrary China has the largest deficit in food
imports (2.9 times that of the US in 2019 and 5 times in 2020).

Hence the US deficit for all products of $923bn in 2019 was 2.2 times
larger than the China surplus of $430bn (and the US deficit of $975bn
in 2020 was 1.8 higher than the China surplus of $530bn) but per
capita the US deficit of $2,806 in 2019 ($2,946 in 2020) was 7.9
times higher than the China surplus of $300 and, in 2020, it was 7.9
higher than the China surplus of $371. With India the US deficit of
all products was 5.9 times higher in 2019 (10.5 times higher in 2020)
and, per capita, the US deficit was 24.6 times that of India (43.9
times in 2020!). The EU28 deficit of all products of $230bn in 2019
was 65% of the China surplus of $430bn (the EU deficit of $188bn in
2020 was 35% of the China surplus in 2020) and, per capita, the EU
deficit of $545 in 2019 ($366 in 2020) was 82% higher that the China
surplus of $300 (98.5% higher in 2010. The EU deficit was 56% higher
than that of India in 2019 (twice higher in 2020) and, per capita, it
was 4.8 times higher in 2019 (5.5 times higher in 2020). 

<p>
For food products as well as for food + agricultural raw materials
Canada and India were the only of the 6 countries to have a positive
balance in 2019 and 2020 (the EU balance is negative because of fish
and preparations). The larger food deficit of China ($65.2bn in 2019
and $89.8bn in 2020) than those of the US ($22.3bn in 2019 and 17.9
bn in 2020) implies it was 34.3% of that of China in 2019 (19.9% in
2020) but, per capita, the US food deficit was 1.5 times higher than
that of China in 2019 (and 13.5% lower in 2020). Compared to India
food surplus of $13.7bn in 2019 and $14.4bn in 2020 (despite its
large number of undernourished people!), the US food deficit was 1.6
times lower than the India surplus in 2019 (1.3 times lower in 2020)
and, per capita, it was 6.8 times lower in 2019 (5.27 times lower in
2020). The EU28 food deficit was only 12.5% that of China in 2019
(4.0% in 2020) but, per capita, it was 34.9% that of China in 2019
(11.2% in 2020). The EU28 food deficit was 6 times lower than the
India food surplus in 2019 (29.5% lower in 2020) and, per capita, the
EU food surplus was 59% higher than the Indian food surplus in 2019
(71.2 higher in 2020).     

<p>
Finally, the US deficit in food + agricultural raw materials was of
only 13.6% that of China in 2019 (10.5% in 2020) and, per capita, it
was only lower by 59.1% in 2019 (45.7% in 2020). With India the US
deficit was 1.63 times lower than that of China in 2019 (1.25 times
lower in 2020). The EU balance of food + agricultural raw materials
was 9.2% of that of China in 2019 24.5% lower in 2020) and, per
capita, (2.2% in 2020) but, per capita, of 34.9% of that of China in
2019 (11.2% in 2020). It was 121.9% lower than that of India in 2019
(24.5% lower in 2020) and, per capita, it was 324.2% lower than that
of India in 2019 (65.9% lower in 2020).

<u><b>V – Comparison of the agricultural supports of the 6
countries in 2019</b></u>
<p>
Despite the theoretical and operational limitations of OECD
indicators of agricultural supports, as they are used worldwide let
us compare their levels in the major Western economies – USA, EU28,
Canada, Japan – with those of China and India. 

<p>
The OECD most significant indicator is the TSE
(total agricultural subsidies) per agricultural working unit (AWU),
but the MPS (market price support) is excluded because it concerns
essentially import protection, particularly since 2014 when all
explicit export subsidies were eliminated. In 2019 the US TSE-MPS was
at $92.966 billion (bn)<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote3anc" href="#sdfootnote3sym">3</a></sup>
which, divided by 2.363 million (mn) AWU, implied an average subsidy
of $39,342 per AWU. At the same time the EU28 TSE-MPS was of $97.237
bn which, divided by 8.954 mn AWU, implied an average subsidy of
$10,860 per AWU. And China TSE-MPS was of $93.386 bn which, divided
by 211.780 mn AWU, implied an average subsidy of $4,747 per AWU. In
other words the US subsidy per AWU was 8.3 times that of China and
that of the EU28 2.3 times. And the TSE-MPS per AWU was 11.1 times
that of India for the USA and 3.1 times higher that to India for the
EU28. 

<p>
We could argue that we should delete the US domestic food aid but in
that case we must do the same for India but here we have a problem of
inconsistency between the data of OECD and the notifications made to
the WTO for the US as for India: if the US domestic food aid was
notified at $94.618 bn in the WTO green box for 2018-19, the OECD
data show that the US non-commodity specific transfers to consumers
from taxpayers for domestic food aid were of $40.192 bn in 2019. And
if India has notified to the WTO $17.212 bn of Public stockholding
for food security purposes for 2019 in the green box (plus $5.004 bn
of market price support to rice in the AMS), the OECD data show that
the same non-commodity specific transfers to consumers from taxpayers
were of $16.932 bn in 2019 (but jumped to $58.148 bn in 2020). But
China notified only $1.149 bn of domestic food aid for 2016. 

<p>
If we exclude from the US TSE-MPS the $40.192 bn the subsidy per AWU
falls to $52.744 bn and the US (TSE-MPS)/AWU falls to $22,333 so that
the US agricultural subsidy was still 4.7 times larger than that of
China and 6.3 times that of India. In the same way if we exclude from
the Indian TSE-MPS its domestic food aid of $16.932 its (TSE-MPS)/AWU
falls to $2,730 so that the US agricultural subsidy was 8.2 times
that of India. On the other hand the EU28 domestic food aid is very
low because most EU members have large social security benefits (of
which minimal wages) and, furthermore, most EU direct payments are
not notified to the WTO as they are allegedly decoupled and non-trade
distorting.

and national sources; VOP: value of agricultural production; TSE:
total support estimate (inflated for the US by domestic food aid);
MPS: market price support (mainly by consumers); AWU: agricultural
working units   

<p>
Furthermore SOL has shown that the Agreement on
Agriculture (AoA) methodology to assess the domestic food aid can be
applied to the US instead of notifying all of it in the green box, so
that, <span style="background: #ffffff">for
8 products only – three cereals (wheat flour, corn flour, rice),
three meats (beef, pork, poultry), dairy in milk equivalent and eggs
– the US should have notified to the WTO $12.785 bn in 2012 for its
product-specific AMS of its domestic food aid. </span>This
would have been 5.5 times larger than the Indian corresponding AMS
for rice plus wheat. Yet it is India which is condemned by the WTO
rules while the US notifies all its domestic food aid in the green
box!<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote4anc" href="#sdfootnote4sym">4</a></sup>
<p>
<u><b>Conclusion</b></u>
<p>
It is clear that on the five issues – levels of income and wages,
social performance, environment performance, trade performance and
agricultural support – China and India are entitled to claim a
status of developing country availing of a special and differential
treatment under WTO rules. 

<p>
Many other reasons plead for this status, which can be seen in the
following papers below.
<p>
However, this justification of China's and India's status of
developing economies should not be seen as an endorsement of many
other aspects of their policies both internally – particularly in
terms of undemocratic regimes and of the persecution of Muslims in
China with Uighurs and in India since Narendra Mody – and
externally, notably the development of Chinese economic imperialism
with the Silk Roads, and the risk of too large indebtedness of Africa
to China.

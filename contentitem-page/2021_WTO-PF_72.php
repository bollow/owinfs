MC12 offers a unique opportunity to reanimate the WTO’s negotiations on a variety of issues that directly affects the lives of the citizens of Members, and will be determinative regarding the future of the WTO’s claim to multilateralism. Will Members prioritize human life over pharmaceutical profit by agreeing multilaterally to a TRIPS waiver? Will members conclude multilateral agreements to ensure Members can utilize trade for development, such as through agriculture, fisheries, and the development agenda? Will some members threaten the very multilateralism of the WTO by insisting on plurilateral “JSIs” in spite of the fact that there are multilateral mandates on all of the issues covered? How will new administrations in many countries affect the potential outcome of negotiations at MC12 and multilateralism in general? Ambassadors to the WTO and civil society experts will share insights about what outcomes at MC12 could revive multilateralism to the benefit of all Members.

This webinar informed about the ongoing negotiations fisheries subsidies that are being pushed for conclusion at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) 13th Ministerial Conference in Abu Dhabi on February 26-29. Subsidies, especially given to small fishers, are at stake and therefore the issue is of great interest for all fisher groups. This meeting is an opportunity to hear what's being negotiated, how it will impact fisher groups and discuss what can be done to protect small-scale fishers.
<p>
Speakers include:
<p>
Adam Wolfenden, Deputy Coordinator, Pacific Network on Globalisation<br>
Ranja Sengupta, Senior Researcher, Third World Network
<p>
The WTO Ministerial didn't result in a new fisheries subsidies agreement, meaning that negotiations will continue.

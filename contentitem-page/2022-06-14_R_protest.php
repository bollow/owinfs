<b>Geneva, Switzerland</b>--Today, a group of civil society working together through the global Our World
Is Not For Sale (OWINFS) network, performed a parody of the undemocratic “Green Room” practice
before negotiators at the 12th Ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Activists
representing the European Union, United States, Switzerland, and United Kingdom surrounded
themselves within green fabric as they told activists representing LDCs and developing countries
outside the barrier that they were not on the list and could not join their negotiations. The secretive
Green Room practice has been common leading up to and during this ministerial meeting, leading to
outcomes that do not reflect the interests of a majority of WTO members.

Over 50 civil society experts – trade unionists, farmers, development advocates, and consumer
activists – from more than 23 countries have traveled to Geneva for the 12th Ministerial meeting of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) as part of the global Our World Is Not For Sale (OWINFS)
network. Civil society delegates are at the WTO from: India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines, Pacific
Islands, Ghana, Liberia, Malawi, Morocco, South Africa, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Argentina, Brazil,
Uruguay, USA, Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and the UK.
<p>
Groups put an <a href="2022_retract_access">NGO statement on the WTO decision to retract their previously granted access to the
Ministerial Conference on its opening day on 12 June 2022. Their press conference on 12 June can be
viewed <a href="2022-06-12_briefing">here</a>. These and many other documents of analysis by CSOs are available here:

<p>
On the TRIPS waiver on intellectual property rules to save lives during the Covid pandemic, civil
society leaders urged countries to reject the counter-proposal Director General text with its onerous
new TRIPS+ provisions which would actually add new obligations to TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of
Intellectual Property Rights) on developing countries rather than save lives.
They also demanded a permanent solution to public stockholding, so that developing countries can
achieve food security through increased production. They urged delegates to reject the anti-
development fisheries text that is on the table, and to start again with a pro-development proposals.
<p>
And they condemned the Green Room tactics and false promise of “WTO Reform” which is actually a
developed country agenda to abandon multilateralism, consensus, and development architecture of
the WTO. See <a href="https://ourworldisnotforsale.net/MC12">https://ourworldisnotforsale.net/MC12</a> for analysis.

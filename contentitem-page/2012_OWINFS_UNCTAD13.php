To: Governments and Negotiators at the UNCTAD XIII in Doha, Qatar
<p>
Since the onset of the global financial and economic crises, UNCTAD
has played an important role in identifying the key causes of the
crises, assisting developing countries in seeking solutions to the
impacts of the crises, and advocating for the reform of global
economic and finance policies and governance in order to prevent
similar crises from recurring. These are all key roles that no other
multilateral economic institution has fulfilled from a development
perspective. In fact, UNCTAD is well known for having predicted the
crisis in advance, a fact that is to be commended, particularly given
its paucity of resources compared to institutions such as the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Trade Organization
(WTO), and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD), which failed to do so. This prescience builds on a long
history of UNCTAD’s contributions to
development-oriented policies such as the Generalized System of
Preferences, 0.7 percent GNI aid targets, debt cancellation,
international commodity agreements, special and differential
treatment at the WTO, and policy space, among many others. 

<p>
Despite these important contributions, throughout the negotiations
leading up to UNCTAD XIII, the developed countries have tried to
rescind the important mandate of UNCTAD to work on issues of global
macroeconomic and finance policies, and particularly to <i>participate
in global governance</i> on these issues, which are so essential to
global prosperity. In addition, the EU and “JUSCANZ” (Japan, the
United States, Switzerland, Canada, South Korea, Australia, Norway,
New Zealand, and Lichtenstein) have sought to impose a mandate on
UNCTAD to push developing countries to adopt investor protection and
trade policies in accordance with the corporate interests of
developed countries, rather than in the interests of the successful
use of trade and investment for the purposes of sustainable and
inclusive growth within developing countries themselves.
<p>
<b>The outcomes of the UNCTAD XIII conference in Doha, Qatar, April
21-26, 2012, must contribute to the transformations of the global
economy that are necessary for true inclusive and sustainable
development for all:</b>
<p>


<ol>
	<li>It
	is essential that the 2012 UNCTAD Declaration affirms, rather than
	retreats from, the progress made at the UNCTAD XII in Accra. This
	includes an agreement on the need for sustainable as well as
	inclusive growth, as well as the need for UNCTAD to work on the
	inter-related issues of finance, technology, investment, and
	sustainable development, among other key issues. 
	
</ol>
<p>


<ol start="2">
	<li>The
	collective policy analysis must recognize the root causes of the
	global crisis, its impacts, and mandate a role for UNCTAD to
	continue its excellent economic and finance research and critical
	analysis, in order to truly assist developing countries in creating
	solutions to the crises – rather than pushing them to implement
	more of the same deregulatory trade and investment policies that led
	to the global crises in the first place. 
	
</ol>
<p>


<ol start="3">
	<li>Finally,
	the role of UNCTAD as an alternative voice to the “Washington
	Consensus” paradigm – being the only multilateral economic
	institution focused on development – must be strengthened
	vis-à-vis the WTO, the IMF, the World Bank, the OECD, and the G20
	in global economic governance decision-making. 
	
</ol>
<p>
In order to the accomplish these transformations, we call on
developed countries to abandon the pressure on the G77 negotiators,
and instead work together with developing countries to ensure a
forward-looking mandate for UNCTAD which must, among other issues:
<ul>
	<li>
	Specifically recognize the origins, spread, and impacts of the
	global crises, and mandate a role for UNCTAD which includes
	assisting developing countries as well as advocacy in the global
	governance arena in favor of sustainable and inclusive growth;
	<li>
	Affirm the key role of UNCTAD’s research and analysis on
	macroeconomic and financial issues, including exchange
	rates and global imbalances, as well as countercyclical fiscal
	policies that have helped stabilize economies during the global
	crisis.
	<li>
	Include analysis that recognizes both the costs as well as
	opportunities of trade, and directs UNCTAD to assist developing
	countries in utilizing trade for their development, rather than just
	advising them to join the WTO and other “free” trade agreements.
	<li>
	Mandate UNCTAD to determine the contours of a global trade framework
	that is truly development-oriented, and thus to identify the changes
	to the existing WTO and ongoing negotiations that are necessary to
	ensure that governments have the policy space to use trade for
	sustainable and inclusive development, and to regulate in the public
	interest. 
	
	<li>
	Affirm the importance of adequate regulation and supervision of
	financial markets, particularly with regard to crisis prevention and
	resolution, and mandate UNCTAD to play an active role in ensuring
	strong national and global financial regulatory rules.
	<li>
	Acknowledge the problems of investor protection provisions in trade
	and investment agreements and mandate a role for UNCTAD in helping
	developing countries design investment policies that will benefit
	their sustainable and inclusive growth, as well as advocating for
	development-oriented best practices in investment policies globally.
		
	<li>
	Recognize the major impacts of the crisis on employment, and mandate
	UNCTAD to work on the national level with developing countries in
	favor of job creation, and on the international level in favor of
	the Decent Work Agenda in concert with the ILO.
	<li>
	Reassert the need to find solutions to the problem of volatility in
	the global commodities markets and the
	need for fair trade in global agricultural trade towards Food
	Security and Food Sovereignty, and mandate a research and advocacy
	role for UNCTAD on these issues, together with the FAO and
	particularly the Committee on Food Security. 
	
	<li>
	Affirm developed countries’ commitments in ODA and Aid for Trade,
	as well as UNCTAD’s key role in identifying the need for and
	developing mechanisms towards a sustainable sovereign debt work-out
	mechanism, bringing together diverse stake holders to create
	Responsible Lending and Borrowing principles and continued efforts
	on debt cancellation.
	<li>
	Set forth clear analysis of the impact of climate change on
	sustainable and inclusive development, and mandate UNCTAD to
	contribute to the<b> </b>global effort to realize the objectives of
	sustainable and inclusive development vis-à-vis climate change. 
	
</ul>
<p>
These are but a few of the key issues that should form the foundation
of the official declaration that is to guide UNCTAD’s role over the
next four years. More comprehensive analysis on each of these issues
is detailed in the official Civil Society Declaration to UNCTAD XIII.
<p>
In light of the rhetoric surrounding the commitment to a more open,
democratic, and participatory system of global governance that have
become commonplace in recent years, we find the return to the
semi-colonial approach of the developed countries in the UNCTAD
negotiations outrageous. We commend the former leadership and staff
of UNCTAD who spoke up against this unacceptable situation last week,
as well as the G77 for their statement that called the EU and JUSCANZ
to account for their intransigent positions.   

<p>
As representatives of developed and developing countries of myriad
stages of development, we know that our own prosperity is deeply
entwined to the sustainable development of all, and thus we call on
all governments of the North and South to join together, to affirm a
strong role for UNCTAD in working towards sustainable and inclusive
development for all.

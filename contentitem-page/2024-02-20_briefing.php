With the February 26-29 13th WTO Ministerial just days away, civil society and academic experts from around the world share what’s at stake at this biggest WTO meeting in years. Main items on the agenda include the long-running fisheries subsidies negotiations, agriculture rules for food security and a set of development proposals that developing countries have been fighting for since the WTO’s inception. Developed countries, boosted by the Secretariat, have also put on the agenda a series of illegitimate plurilateral “Joint Statement Initiatives (JSIs)” that would further entrench corporate power in the areas of investment facilitation, domestic regulation, Big Tech-friendly e-commerce, and now using “environment”. With the WTO in crisis for several years now, overshadowing all these discussions is the question of “WTO reform,” which rich countries are pushing as a secretive means to repeal the fundamental WTO principles of multilateralism and consensus.

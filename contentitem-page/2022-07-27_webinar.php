<p>
Social movements and civil society fighting for economic justice have long shifted their focus away from the WTO and towards bilateral and regional free trade agreements, as well as struggles against debt and financialization. But the outcome of the WTO’s 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12) in Geneva in June likely indicates a resurgence in the need to focus civil society and trade union efforts on the WTO.
  <p>
MC12 concluded with pro-corporate, anti-worker and anti-development outcomes on all major issues of access to medicines, agriculture, fisheries subsidies, digital trade, and the future of the WTO itself. 
  <p>
The agreements should herald a warning to all: rich country governments professing new commitments to sustainable and worker-centered trade are just as likely to push anti-development outcomes and cosmetic window-dressing when it comes to protecting Big Business profits above the public interest. 
  <p>
These outcomes portend new fights on the horizon: on environmental issues in five plurilateral agreements currently under negotiations in the WTO; upcoming fights on investment and expanding the role of corporations in domestic policymaking on services; and much more. 
  <p>
A front-line report-back and considerations of important issues moving forward, including for civil society working on non-WTO related issues.

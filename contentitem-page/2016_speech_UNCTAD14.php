<p>Greetings from over
400 civil society organizations from around the world who are
participating in the UNCTAD XIV CSO Forum; thank you to Dr Kituyi,
the Chair, and the UNCTAD member states for inviting us here to
speak. We hope you have seen both the letter endorsed by 331 CSOs on
the specific mandate, delivered prior to this conference, as well as
the CSO Declaration agreed upon here which is now available here. The
ramifications of the 2008 global financial and economic crisis, and
the current economic model of trade and investment agmts, have
allowed business to develop global supply chains which are infested
with precarious work, child labor and slavery - problems which affect
women disproportionally and which, together with inappropriate and
tax and debt policies, have exacerbated inequality between and among
countries globally. Added to these, the escalating climate and
humanitarian crises and natural disasters threaten the very survival
of humanity, with impoverished and vulnerable peoples and countries
suffering the worst impacts.
<p>UNCTAD is uniquely
positioned to help reverse these trends by playing a leading role in
the global achievement of the ambitious commitments made by all
countries on the Agenda 2030 last year, as well as the follow up to
the Financing for Development process, the Paris Climate Agreement
and the 10th Ministerial of the WTO. 

<p><u>It is absolutely
critical to continue and strengthen UNCTAD’s integrated approach to
the evolution and management of globalization and on the
</u><u><b>interdependence</b></u><u>
of trade, finance, investment and technology as they affect the
growth and development prospects of developing countries</u>.


<p>Paradoxically,
however, the developed countries seek the opposite agenda for
UNCTAD’s future. As is clear from the positions they have taken in
the negotiations on UNCTAD’s mandate, these countries are trying to
curtail UNCTAD’s ability to provide independent and critical policy
perspectives. If they succeed, UNCTAD will be undermined in its role
of providing the much-needed corrective and balance to the chorus of
positions that usually emanate from dominant players like the World
Bank, IMF, the WTO, the OECD, and the like. 

<p>CSOs have been
united in our demands: UNCTAD’s role must be strengthened with
regards to debt issues, and not just debt management; UNCTAD’s role
must be strengthened as the primary stakeholder for the treatment of
tax issues globally; and UNCTAD’s trade work must advocate for a
fair and just trade system, including Special and Differential
Treatment, and for structural transformation especially in Africa;
for investment policies that promotes development, and importantly,
for <b>policy space</b>
for developing countries to undertake development policies. 

<p><u>While a
multilateral system of trade rules is preferable to a fragmented
system, the rules must be fair and balanced, taking into account the
various levels of development, rather than focused on trade
liberalization or simply increasing trade. UNCTAD must play an active
role in assisting developing countries to advocate for a fair
multilateral trading system, </u><u><b>Special
and Differential Treatment (SDT) for all developing countries</b></u><u>,
and addressing the imbalances in the current trade regime,
particularly in agriculture and cotton. It is not “new approaches”
which are needed but the </u><u><b>fulfillment
of the development mandate</b></u><u> of the
DDA. UNCTAD must not be transformed into an implementation agency for
trade agreements concluded elsewhere. </u>

<p><u>Trade and
investment agreements do not support development without the right
policy environment, which necessitates </u><u><b>policy
space</b></u><u>, an effective and
developmental state able to sustain its own resource base responsible
for safeguarding people’s human rights, gender equality, and a more
coherent, inclusive and representative global architecture for
sustainable development, with broader and stronger participation by
developing countries. </u>

<p><u>UNCTAD’s trade
work must also continue and strengthen its mandate to support
developing countries in their processes towards </u><u><b>regional
integration</b></u><u>, as well as helping
them </u><u><b>assess the increasingly complex
(positive or negative) implications of plurilateral and mega-regional
trade agreements</b></u><u>.</u>
<p><u>Given UNCTAD’s
long history encouraging developing countries to sign International
Investment Agreements (IIAs) and the negative impacts developing
countries have experienced, particularly due to the Investor-State
Dispute Settlement (ISDS) mechanisms, </u><u><b>UNCTAD’s
mandate should be intensely invested in helping developing countries
to unwind and reform these agreements and to craft investment
policies that will ensure a positive impact on national or regional
development</b></u><u> </u><u><b>strategies</b></u><u>.
UNCTAD’s members should strengthen its mandate to support not the
attraction of investment as a goal in itself but rather its
contribution to development. The establishment of an
Intergovernmental Expert Group (IGEG) on Trade and Investment Rules
and Policy Reform would be helpful in this regard. </u>

<p><u><b>The above work
necessitates research and policy analysis including positive and
negative impacts of trade rules on national or regional development
strategies, and on the achievement of the SDGs, independently of the
WTO, which does not share the developmental mission of UNCTAD. </b></u>

<p><u><b>Common but
Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR) and SDT are long-standing
multilaterally-negotiated principles</b></u><u>
that recognize that developed and developing countries cannot be
treated in the same manner because of their differing development and
economic circumstances. </u>

<p><u>UNCTAD should be
involved in monitoring the role of the private sector, particularly
foreign investors and their impacts (both positive and negative) on
mobilization of domestic resources, fiscal and debt sustainability,
development, human rights, the SDGs and climate goals. In particular,
we strongly caution about support and promotion of </u><u><b>Public
Private Partnerships (PPPs).</b></u>
<p><u><b>Technology
transfer</b></u><u> is essential to the
enabling of sustainable development and UNCTAD should continue to
take a lead role in </u><u><b>supporting these
efforts by developing countries rather than in enforcing intellectual
property rules </b></u><u>that benefit
protectionist patent- and copyright- holders in developed countries.</u>
<p><i><u>Recent policy
initiatives in the G7, the G20 and the OECD have created momentum for
legal and right-based solutions to the deficits of decent work
through living wages and living income in global supply chains. It is
timely to examine ways to utilize the UN Guiding Principles on
Business and Human Rights with a view to establishing accountability
and liability of business enterprises. UNCTAD should work to create
consensus in multilateral institutions to address the lack of
extra-territorial liability for business activities, including with
mandatory human rights due diligence. (unfortunately cut for lack of
time)</u></i>
<p><u>To further allow
implementation of these mandates, there is a need to scale up the
international financial and human resource support of member
governments towards UNCTAD and its overall mandate. The organization
should not become more dependent on project-based funding from
developed countries, or priorities would shift in the direction of
donor states rather than the agreed-upon mandate.</u>
<p><u>As civil society
organizations we urge you to adopt the above positions and ensure
that UNCTAD continues and strengthens its role in the integrated
relationship of trade, finance, investment, macroeconomics, and
technology as they affect the growth and development prospects of all
developing countries.</u>

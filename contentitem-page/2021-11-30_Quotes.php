representing more than 200 million members around the world.&nbsp; It
opposed only by a few governments in the WTO who are acting as
clients of Big Pharmaceutical corporations.  The WTO’s rules
literally protect billionaire’s ability to become
multi-billionaires on the backs of millions of people who are dying.
<p>The
WTO is fundamentally flawed. It should not be a “trade”
organization that decides whether millions of people live or die
during a pandemic. There were four other areas of negotiations in the
WTO with advanced negotiations headed to a conclusion - domestic
regulation, fisheries, agriculture, and a Ministerial Declaration -
but the EU has not even allowed text-based negotiations to start on
the one thing that will end the pandemic. That is why over 130 of us
called for the Ministerial to be postponed last week. That’s why
people are rallying this week in cities around the world to protest
the #WTO’s lethal rule, as you can see from our global Call to
Action. #Vaccine apartheidists have blood on their hands. And the
WTO’s rules protect the murderers. TRIPS WAIVER NOW! Thank you to
all the people around the world saying PEOPLE BEFORE PROFIT! 

<p>Vaccine
apartheid created the conditions under which this new Omicron variant
was able to flourish. Now more than ever it is crystal clear:
Vaccinating the world is the ONLY way to #end the pandemic. WTO get
out of the way! We need WTO members to agree to remove WTO TRIPS
rules, which are THE BIGGEST barrier to ending the pandemic now.”

<p><b>Caroline
Lukas (MP Green Party - Great Britain)</b>
<p>“By
blocking the demand of so many Global South countries for a TRIPS
waiver, the British Government is not only condemning huge numbers of
people to illness and death, but also undermining its own Covid
response in the UK.  Instead of siding with the interests of big
Pharma, we need our political leaders to recognise that none of us
are safe until all of us are safe - and the best way to achieve that
is to join those calling for the TRIPS waiver.<i>
</i>Instead
of a People’s Vaccine we have a Profit Vaccine.”  

<p><b>Helmut
Scholz (MP-GUE-Germany)</b>
<p>It’s
a question of interests of ALL members of the WTO. WTO rulebook
ALLOWS WTO to have this waiver. Big Pharma is pressing on certain
governments. The European Parliament has agreed now FOUR TIMES to
hold this line to support the waiver. The Commission must be held
accountable.” 

<p><b>Stefanie
Prezioso (MP-Ensemble à Gauche-Switzerland)</b>
<p>Not
only is Switzerland blocking the waiver, but our government is being
very non-transparent about its contracts with Big Pharma, such as
Moderna. It has a contract with Moderna to build one of the first
production facilities here and is allowing Moderna to avoid paying
taxes to our neighbors. Millions of dead people are asking us to hold
them accountable. We must lift the intellectual property. 

<p><b>Marc
Botenga (MP-GUE-European Parliament - Belgium)</b>
This is a crime against humanity and the European Commission is
complicity. This is a struggle for human rights and we will continue
fighting for it. “Intellectual property rights block global access
to vaccine technology, limiting vaccine production and increasing
global shortages. Big Pharma reaps huge profits at the expense of
global health. In poor countries, only 3% of the population has been
fully vaccinated. These shortages facilitate the circulation of the
virus and thus encourage the emergence of new variants. This needs to
change urgently.”
<p><b>Nicolas
Walder (MP-Green Party-Vice-President Green Party-Switzerland)</b>


<p>«
A l’OMC, la défense par le Conseil fédéral des droits sur les
brevets et donc des énormes marges bénéficiaires de l’industrie
pharmaceutique est indécente et affaiblit gravement la portée des
discours en faveur de la solidarité vaccinale.»
<p>«
Seule la levée des brevets permettra d'offrir un accès
véritablement universel et rapide aux traitements, vaccins et
diagnostiques pour les communautés les plus vulnérables.&nbsp;»&nbsp;
<p>«&nbsp;
La crise sanitaire est une conséquence directe de nos modes de
production et de consommation. C’est ainsi que les communautés les
plus vulnérables subissent de plein fouet une pandémie dont elles
ne sont pas responsables. Leur accès rapide aux vaccins, traitements
et diagnostiques doit être une priorité».&nbsp;
<p><b>Sangeeta
Shashikant (Third World Network)</b>
<p>“According
to official figures, over 5 million people have died of Covid-19. But
the reality is even worse: the Economist estimates that the death
toll is actually 17 million, and the majority is in developing
countries. Not just lives, livelihoods are at stake as well. It’s
the worst crisis since the global financial crisis, and the longer
the pandemic continues, the suffering will continue. This is because
of the lack of equity in treatments, diagnostics, and vaccines.
Remove the legal barriers to production, so that manufacturers all
over the world can address their needs. The supply constraints are
artificial. Developing country manufacturers were supplying vaccines
all over the world. They have WHO pre-qualification. When the
pandemic emerged, there were promises of global solidarity. But what
we have seen is global obstruction by rich countries, which have
vaccinated the majority of their populations. We need a meaningful
outcome so that we can scale up production of vaccines, tests,
treatments, and medical products, and the only way to do so is to
waive patents, trade secrets, copyright, and industrial designs for
the prevention, containment and treatment of Covid-19.”
<p><b>Fatima
Hassan (Health Justice Initiative-South Africa)</b>
<p>“I’m
speaking here from South Africa, because we were banned from
traveling, because our highly trained scientists were very
transparent and shared the information on the Omicron variant with
the world. While we boost the global north with 3rd and 4th shots,
let’s work to boost equity in the global south too - many are
waiting for shot 1. The WTO has become irrelevant to the equity
agenda- it's delay is contributing to vaccine apartheid, new variants
and suffering - why will it not listen to 110 states that support the
waiver - this is ridiculous- we are in a pandemic. It took only a few
hours to shut down the world economy because of a variant. But for
more than a year, the countries in the rich north will not take on
the Pharma industry. As a person who grew up under apartheid, this is
vaccine apartheid. We are going to have more variants if we do not
scale up production for the world. But we are in a continent that
only has a 7% vaccination rate in Africa. Most countries have not
received supplies. COVAX is unable to meet its deliveries, and many
of the shipments have come randomly and just before they expire. We
have been told to wait until March 2022 to get their first or second
shot, even health workers have not been protected. Governments of
Germany, UK, Switzerland are scared of the CEOs and boardmembers of
pharmaceutical companies and are beholden to them.  The WTO is not
the solution to address global apartheid. Stop messing with our
lives. Pass this waiver right away. We don’t need travel bans - we
need global solidarity.”  

<p><b>Roman
Vega (People’s Health Movement, Colombia)</b>
<p>People
are dying, in urban and rural areas, in countries of the global
South. We need to increase our unity in achieving the right to health
by strengthening our struggle for a public and universal health
system, by achieving universal and equitable access to vaccines,
medicines and protective equipment against the Covid-19 pandemic. 

<p><b>Rob
Johnston,&nbsp;International Transport Workers’ Federation&nbsp;(ITF)</b>
<p>It’s
the very same transport workers who are now at risk. The same
governments who say they recognize the contribution of those workers
to global trade, are now blocking them from getting access to
vaccines. Global Supply chains are GSC - they do not function if
workers do not have access to vaccines. We call for action now to
enable workers across the world, populations, and communities, to
have access. 

<p><b>Baba
Aye, Public Services International (PSI)</b>
<p>When
the vaccination campaign started a year ago, the WHO set two targets
for 2021: within 100 days, health workers around the world would all
be vaccinated. Second that by the end of this year, 40% of people in
ALL countries would be vaccinated. The centrality of health workers
to the Covid response informed the first target. But today only 1 in
4 health workers in Africa have been vaccinated. 103 countries will
not make the mark of 40% vaccination by the end of this year. A few
multinational corporations are profiting from vaccines largely
developed by public funds, and they have the backing of a few
powerful countries. This is unacceptable. The people who feel the
impact of this most, are the poor, workers, people in poor
communities, racialized communities. It is difficult to carry out
contact tracing in slums, in far-out rural areas. People in shanties
cannot quarantine. We have to put people over profit, health before
wealth. Very important for now. As the WHO has pointed out, we might
be entering an era of pandemic. Countries against the TRIPS waiver
are trying to talk about a Pandemic Treaty. 

<p><b>Julie
Ferrua,&nbsp;Union Syndicale Solidaires (France)</b>
<p>«&nbsp;Avec
les brevets, n<span style="background: #ffffff">ous
payons deux fois les vaccins. Une première fois à travers le
financement public de la recherche, une deuxième fois au moment de
l’achat des doses à prix fort. En France,2,5 milliards d’euros
payés par notre Sécurité Sociale, l'équivalent salaire annuel et
cotisations, de l'embauche, de 59000&nbsp;</span>infirmier-ères<span style="background: #ffffff">&nbsp;!&nbsp;»</span>
<p><b>Richard
Hill,&nbsp;Association for Proper Internet Governance (Switzerland)</b>
<p>“It’s
been said that pharmaceutical corporations need patents so they can
make profits so they can invest in research &amp; Development. We
know that’s not true for the Covid vaccines which was largely
funded by public research funds. It’s also not true in general,
because in reality, Big Pharma acts rationally within the capitalist
system to maximize shareholder value, that is, to maximize stock
prices. And that is done by NOT investing in new products which are
not likely to be highly profitable, but rather by acquiring
organizations, engaging in stock buybacks, share buybacks, and other
financial manipulation. This is well documented I can send the
research to anyone who is interested. And it’s called
financialization - financialization of the pharmaceutical industry.
This is rational behavior, maximizing shareholder value, and it does
not involve a lot of R&amp;D. It involves things such as
“evergreening” - maintaining a patent so that is keeps in force
longer than its normal value; preventing generics, for example in
Switzerland a generic medicine is not available for a certain type of
drug, so it costs ten times as much as it costs across the border in
France.” 

<p><b>Pierre-Yves
Maillard, Swiss-MP - Union Syndicale Suisse (USS)</b>
<p>«&nbsp;La
levée des brevets sur les vaccins permettrait d’accélérer la
protection de toutes les populations du monde et réduirait la
défiance qu’inspirent les entreprises qui font des profits
colossaux grâce à un bien de première nécessité.&nbsp;»
<p><b>Franco
Cavalli, Forum Alternativo (Switzerland)</b>
<p>“I
am an oncologist and former president of the international union
against cancer. We have the same situation with cancer as with
Covid-19 vaccines. The new treatments are unavailable to patients
worldwide because of patents. Hundreds of thousands die prematurely
every year because of patents. I am president of MediCuba Europe,
which encompasses groups across Europe, supporting the development of
the Cuban vaccines. WHO has told me that they are a great hope for
the world, also because they have been developed with a traditional
technology, and they don’t need super cold storage capabilities. So
the Cuban vaccine also is great news for the world.”  

<p><b>Christian
Dandrès (MP-socialist party-Switzerland)</b><br/>
&quot;L'accaparement
de la production de médicaments et de vaccins par un secteur privé
est une menace pour la santé de l'humanité qui a un destin
biologique commun.&quot;
<p><b>Frank
Prouhet (Collectif brevets sur les vaccins anti-covid. Stop
Requisition-France)</b><br/>
&quot;The
time is action to go to the streets. It is not time for travel bans.
The
priority is to have access to vaccines!&quot;
«&nbsp;Public
Citizen et les chercheurs du Kings College de Londres ont calculé
qu'avec 9 milliards de dollars, on pouvait produire en un an de quoi
vacciner 4,5 milliards de personnes, soit le nombre de personnes qui
n'ont pas accès aux vaccins pour cause d'apartheid vaccinal.&nbsp;»
<p><b>Julie
Steendam (Coordinator of the Initiative European Citizens’
Initiatives: No Profit on Pandemic - Right to a Cure)</b>
<p>“Back
in April 2020, the President of the European Commission Ursula Von
der Leyen said that the &quot;Covid-19 vaccine shall be our universal
common good&quot;. Over 380 organizations call EU citizens to sign
the ‘No Profit on Pandemic’ petition, with the aim to introduce a
legislative proposal to the European Commission to make it stick to
its promises and remove all patent barriers on Covid-19
technologies.”

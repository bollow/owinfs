<b>Geneva, Switzerland</b>—Today, a group of civil society working together through the global Our World
Is Not for Sale (OWINFS) network, present in Geneva for the 12th Ministerial meeting of the World
Trade Organization (WTO), use the human amplification tactic of “Mike Check” to voice their
concerns about the WTO negotiations. Text of the chants is included below.
<p>
On the TRIPS waiver on intellectual property rules to save lives during the Covid pandemic, civil
society leaders urged countries to reject the counter-proposal and onerous new TRIPS+ provisions
which would actually add new obligations to TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property
Rights) on developing countries rather than save lives.
<p>
They also demanded a permanent solution to public stockholding, so that developing countries can
achieve food security through increased production. They urged delegates to reject the anti-
development fisheries text that is on the table, and to start again with a pro-development proposals.
And they condemned the Green Room tactics and false promise of “WTO Reform” which is actually a
developed country agenda to abandon multilateralism, consensus, and development architecture of
the WTO. See <a href="MC12">https://ourworldisnotforsale.net/MC12</a> for analysis.

Over 50 civil society experts – trade unionists, farmers, development advocates, and consumer
activists – from more than 23 countries have traveled to Geneva for the 12th Ministerial meeting of

Groups put an <a href="2022_retract_access">NGO statement on the WTO decision to retract their previously granted access to the
Ministerial Conference on its opening day</a> on 12 June 2022. Their press conference on 12 June can be
viewed here. And a media availability list of NGO experts, many of whom are in Geneva for MC12, is

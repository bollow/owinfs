Most
reports on the upcoming 12<sup>th</sup>
Ministerial Meeting of the World Trade Organization (WTO MC12) focus
on the WTO’s efforts to save its legitimacy amidst its self-imposed
crisis of increased irrelevance. WTO proponents are attempting to
achieve this mirage by ramming through - under conditions of vaccine
apartheid which the institution’s rules enforce - a three-pronged
strategy: 

<ul>
	<li>
	the
	sham so-called “Walker process” as the WTO’s response to
	COVID-19, which will NOT end the pandemic but is just more
	business-as-usual trade liberalization and represents an attempt to
	cover up the WTO’s failure to agree to a TRIPS waiver which would
	allow countries to end the pandemic; 
	
	<li>
	new
	Fisheries Subsidies disciplines that contradict the mandate of the
	Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to include special and
	differential treatment (SDT) at the core of the new disciplines;
	<li>
	and
	by abrogating the WTO’s fundamental mandate, which is of a
	multilateral organization, by paving the way for the legitimization
	of WTO-illegal “Joint Statement Initiative” plurilaterals, and
	by imposing a new process of WTO “reform” which would open the
	path for to abolish development flexibilities in the WTO, without
	which developing countries never would have agreed to the WTO’s
	founding in the first place. 
	
</ul>
<p>
Instead,
the world needs the WTO to turn around its agenda, and to focus
instead on:
<ul>
	<li>
	removing
	WTO barriers to ending the pandemic, by agreeing to the waiver on
	Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rules (TRIPS) on
	COVID-19 related treatments, diagnostics, and vaccines;
	<li>
	preserving
	and expanding SDT in the Fisheries Subsidies negotiations, as well
	as throughout the WTO, as mandated by the 2001 mandate; 
	
	<li>
	removing
	WTO barriers to food security by finding a permanent solution to
	public stockholding, as agreed in the mandate from 2013; 
	
	<li>
	and
	many other changes to existing WTO rules. 
	
</ul>

<h2>Quotes</h2>
<b>Professor Jane Kelsey</b>, Faculty of Law, University of Auckland, Aotearoa New Zealand:
<blockquote>
“In
summary on the three main purilateral “Joint Statement
Initiatives”, even champions of “Investment Facilitation” admit
there’s no way to get&nbsp;an agreed text&nbsp;into
WTO. There are major disagreements on&nbsp;e-commerce, where they can
only harvest the low hanging fruit.&nbsp;Services&nbsp;domestic
regulation is the stalking horse being used&nbsp;to
get JSIs on the agenda and create some chimera of legitimacy. In the
process, these “rules-driven” Members are abandoning the WTO’s
own fundamentals of multilateralism, consensus-decision making, and
special and differential treatment. All this&nbsp;exposes
the power politics of WTO as&nbsp;morally, ethically, ideologically
bankrupt.
<p>
“The
plurilateral “Joint Statement Initiatives” are a political
strategy by the old rule-makers to&nbsp;remake WTO&nbsp;to restore
their control.&nbsp;The
decision of self-appointed subgroups of WTO Members to
launchplurilateral negotiations on their favoured new issues, while
sabotaging the Doha round, and adopt new rules through schedules that
bypass requirements to amend WTO agreements by consensus, lack any
legal&nbsp;legitimacy.&nbsp;The
determination to ignore these illegalities is ironic coming from
champions of the &nbsp;“global rules-based system”. If this
strategy is allowed to succeed, the WTO will become even more&nbsp;
of a haven for rich and powerful countries to make rules on behalf of
their transnational corporations andexclude the priorities and voices
of less powerful countries and peoples&nbsp;from
its agenda.”
</blockquote>
<p>

<b>Adam Wolfenden</b>, Pacific Network on Globalization, Fiji:
<blockquote>
<p>
“The
fisheries subsidies text is a win for those who have already used
their advantage to build their fleets, develop the capacity to meet
the WTO's notifications requirements, and have historically
overfished all around the globe. This fails the SDG mandate,
sustainability and development.&quot;
<p>
“The
imbalance in the latest text can be seen between the disproportionate
burdens falling on developing countries and those with aspirations
for domestic fishing fleets. This is evident through the lack of
common-but-differentiated responsibility in the text as there is no
acknowledgement of those with the historical responsibility for the
state of global fish stocks and subsequent need for them to undertake
the greatest burden of commitments.”
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Ranja Sengupta</b>, Third World Network, India:
<blockquote>
<p>
“The agriculture Chair’s text
has elbowed out all mandated and critical issues of interest to
developing countries at MC12, but is pushing for additional
obligations on market access and export restrictions, limiting
developing countries’ policy space to ensure food security and
rural livelihoods, even during such a critical time as this.”
</blockquote>


<p>
<b>Deborah James</b>, facilitator of Our World Is Not for Sale (OWINFS) global network:
<blockquote>
<p>
“The contours of the battle are
clear. The best outcome for humanity would be: a full TRIPS waiver,
an expansion of development flexibilities, including in fisheries
subsidies, and a pro-food security outcome in agriculture. 
<p>
“But this outcome is not favored
by pro-corporate governments. A more likely scenario could be that
rich governments offer a partial waiver that is too complicated to
use, in exchange for steep, binding and permanent concessions on
so-called WTO reform, the legitimization of plurilaterals, fisheries
subsidies that harm artisanal fisherfolk, and nothing on food
security. But India, South Africa and other countries have been
clear: they want a strong waiver to save lives, not a weak waiver to
“save” the WTO. 
<p>
“In this scenario, the EU, U.S.
and other countries will rev up the Blame Game, trying to ensuring
that media portray India and South Africa as “blocking progress”
towards consensus and that it is the EU that is trying to save lives
and the WTO (through the “Walker process” and other such fig
leaves.) 

<p>
“Then, it will be up to civil
society to ensure that the world knows the truth, and to live to
fight for the waiver - a strong waiver that will help end the
pandemic - and the <u><a href="https://ourworldisnotforsale.net/2021_WTO-Turnaround">transformation
of our global trade system</a></u>
- another day.” 
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Kinda Mohamadieh</b>, Senior Researcher, Third World Network, Lebanon:
<blockquote>
<p>
“Developing
countries have long called for reforming the multilateral trading
system in favour of large vulnerable constituencies such as small
farmers and producers and workers, they have called to review and
rebalance existing WTO rules in order to address implementation
challenges that they have been facing and to strengthen and
operationalise special and differential treatment. In contrast what
developed countries, like the EU and US have been pushing for is
advocating to undermine special and differential treatment, they have
been advocating to inject into the WTO agenda issues which would
constrain policy tools available and undermine inclusivity in the
negotiations process. So basically altering the decision making
procedures, pushing for normalising plurilateral approaches and
basically undermining the multilateral nature of the organisation,
and pushing for opening more space for big business under the notion
of stakeholderism, big business influence on both the agenda setting
and the overall processes of the WTO. 
<p>
“If MC12
continues like this, it will be the door to reinventing the WTO as a
power based rather than a rules based organisation. WE will see more
grabbing of space in this organisation, away from developing
countries and their development issues to corporations, for more
corporate power grab basically of the WTO. This will significantly
undermine any possibility of correcting the trade rules and will
undermine any possibility that this organisation will deliver for its
smaller members, developing countries and LDCs.”  
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Sangeeta Shashikant</b>, Third World Network Malaysia:
<blockquote>
<p>
“Every day there is a delay of
access to vaccines, diagnostics, therapeutics, more people are dying
and developing countries and LDCs are disproportionately impacted by
this inequitable access. It is also estimated that unless we do
something very urgent and concrete more than 200 million additional
cases are expected until Dec 2022 and many many millions more are
hospitalized and continue to die every day. What we need is urgent
action to address supply constraints and equitable access – timely
availability and affordability of vaccines, diagnostics, therapeutics
and other COVID 19 products. We need to scale up and diversify
production. We need to leverage global production capacity.
<p>
“Instead what has happened in the
WTO in the last few months, Ambassador Walker from New Zealand was
asked to facilitate a process on WTO’s response to COVID 19. He
came up with a text. The text made no mention of TRIPS waiver
proposal that is actually being discussed as they said that this is
being discussed in another council of the WTO. How can WTO’s
response be credible in the absence of TRIPS waiver proposal?”

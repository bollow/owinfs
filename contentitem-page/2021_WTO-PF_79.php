Since the plurilateral Joint Statement Initiatives were launched at MC11 in Buenos Aires there have been quite intense discussions about their substantive and legal implications, especially for developing countries, as well as for the multilateral trading system more broadly. This Panel will provide a robust, critical analysis of the legality of plurilateral Joint Statement Initiatives in the WTO from developing country perspectives.

The multilateral trading system is not fit for purpose and has contributed to skyrocketing inequality, along with a race to the bottom on rights and regulations. To rebuild trust, the WTO must reaffirm its commitment to sustainable development as stated in the Marrakesh Agreement, and explicitly affirm its support for human and labour rights. To tackle the challenges of the 21st century, a reformed WTO must set an enforceable minimum floor on rights and support decent work, while making sure to give countries the policy space to pursue development goals and full employment goals. Setting a floor on human and labour rights, and environmental standards will ensure fair competition and deliver on improving conditions for working people in both developing and developed countries.

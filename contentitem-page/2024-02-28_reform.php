The 13th World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conference (MC13) is
being promoted as a “reform ministerial”. What does that really mean? This
briefing explains the systemic and process aspects of this “reform” agenda,
especially for developing countries. Expert speakers will address dispute
settlement, the plurilateral Joint Statement Initiatives (JSIs), the proposed MC13
outcome document/ministerial declaration, and the process at MC13 itself.

  <li>Abhijit Das, independent researcher &amp; former Head of Centre for WTO Studies,

  <li>Kinda Mohamadieh, Legal Advisor and Senior Researcher, Third World Network
</ul>
Moderator: Rangarirai Machemedze, Coordinator of Southern and Eastern

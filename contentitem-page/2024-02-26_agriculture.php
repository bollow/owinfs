This event has focused on the current dynamics of the agricultural negotiatons leading up to MC13 and possible deliverables from it.
<p>
Agriculture and food security has always been an important issue in the WTO specially for
developing countries, which have reaffirmed its criticality in recent times. A key need is to ensure the development of the agriculture sector, both as a source of food and livelihoods.
<p>
The question is, can the WTO deliver on the type of trade rules that are needed, by critically reviewing the Agreement on Agriculture, by delivering on outstanding issues, by providing policy space to developing countries for their agricultural development?

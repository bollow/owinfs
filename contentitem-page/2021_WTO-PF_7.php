This session will discuss the elements of copyright policy that is needed to respond to the COVID pandemic and other emergencies, and how trade and international intellectual property law should accommodate such measures. Copyright is implicated in the treatment, prevention, and containment of COVID and in the response to other emergencies. Many countries lack express rights in their copyright laws to enable remote and digital uses of works for education and scientific research, impede the repair of medical devices requiring software, and have no provision for public health use of tools, such as computational algorithms, needed to produce vaccines. This session will discuss how countries can respond to these challenges within the confines of the WTO TRIPS agreement and whether further clarifications of such flexibility is warranted to ensure that emergency action can be taken now and in the future.

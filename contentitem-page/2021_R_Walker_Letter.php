<p>Major
international civil society organisations exposed the sham of the
so-called “Walker process” as a cynical scheme to distract from
the failure of the WTO to resolve the COVID pandemic by agreeing to
waive intellectual property (IP) barriers to Covid treatments, tests,
and vaccines, through a <u><a href="https://ourworldisnotforsale.net/2021_L_Walker_Process">letter
sent today to Members of the WTO</a></u>.


<p>Having
refused for over a year to take the steps identified by the global
health community and supported by over 100 WTO members to resolve the
pandemic, trade negotiators from the EU, Switzerland, Canada, the UK,
and a few other countries - representing the interests of Big Pharma
over their own citizens and global public health - have invented a
diversionary tactic called the “<u><a href="https://twn.my/title2/briefing_papers/MC12/briefings/WTO%20reform%20&amp;%20WTO%20pandemic%20response%20TWNBP%20MC12.pdf">Walker
Process</a></u>.” Allegedly on “Trade and Health,” this
process is designed to try to save the WTO from its increasing
irrelevance and illegitimacy, by drawing attention away from the
WTO’s failure to remove the <u><a href="https://www.twn.my/title2/intellectual_property/trips_waiver_proposal.htm">barriers
of its Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rules (TRIPS) agreement</a></u>
to resolving the pandemic. 

<p>The
letter notes that “Ambassador Walker unilaterally tabled a proposed
text <u>which is clearly not designed to resolve the pandemic</u>.
Rather, the draft text promotes the same liberalization demands made
by developed countries in various fora and interventions that will
further constrain regulatory space and policy tools available to WTO
Members…” 

<p>Walker’s
text also calls on WTO Members to establish a “Work Plan on
Pandemic Preparedness and Resilience.” However, the main intent of
this work-plan appears to be to “push the liberalization and
deregulatory interests of developed countries and undermine existing
mandates” within the WTO which are of interest to developing
countries that were never delivered. Notably, the Walker process
<u>specifically excludes discussion on the most important topic: the
TRIPS waiver</u>. The letter calls on WTO members to immediately
agree to the TRIPS waiver as proposed.
<p>The
letter thus notes that the “reality is that the Walker process is a
deplorable attempt by the WTO to cover up what should be a grave
humiliation: its inability to agree to remove key obstacles to
resolving the COVID-19 pandemic by waiving intellectual property
barriers as per the TRIPS waiver proposal. Millions of people have
died because of the WTO’s vaccine apartheid and inequitable
access.” 

<p>The letter was
endorsed by major global health, development, and human rights groups
such as Amnesty International, Global
Health Advocates, Health Poverty Action (HPA), the Latin American
Network for Access to Medicine (RedLAM), Oxfam International, the
Peoples Health Movement (PHM), and the People's
Vaccine Alliance, which itself is
a coalition of organisations including UNAIDS, health NGOs and global
union federations such as International Trade Union
Confederation, International Transport Workers’ Federation, Public
Services International, UNI Global Union which represent more than
200 million workers in more than 163 countries,
as well as multiple national and
international groups. 

<p>The
letter also condemns the efforts by developed countries to normalize
the “<u><a href="https://ourworldisnotforsale.net/2021/Kelsey_JSI_legitimacy.pdf">Joint
Statement Initiatives</a></u> (JSIs)” launched at the Buenos
Aires Ministerial and henceforward, “which
will undermine the multilateral nature of the organization and its
ability to deliver anything useful for developing countries and LDCs.
They also attack developing country self-designation, a key legal
principle of the WTO, thus eventually limiting
the availability of special and differential treatment to many
developing countries and LDCs.”
<p>The
letter also points out that the WTO is aware of the negative public
perception of putting pharma profits over solving the pandemic, and
thus has made every effort to shut out civil society, drastically
reducing the space for CSO participation at MC12. 

<p>CSOs
thus urge members to: agree immediately to the TRIPS waiver as
proposed; to halt the sham Walker process’ on further
liberalization and imposition of regulatory constraints and instead
focus on real solutions; to focus WTO reform efforts on removing
barriers to development; to halt all “Green Room” processes; to
ensure full access to participation by all WTO Members to all
negotiations; and to restore at least the very minimum levels of
participation of civil society to the Ministerial Conference.
<p><b>BACKGROUND</b>:
despite the agreement of the global public health community on the
importance of the TRIPS Waiver proposal, after more than one
year since it was proposed, there does not seem to be much progress
towards a meaningful outcome. The proposal to waive certain
provisions of the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Agreement
(TRIPS) in the WTO to resolve COVID-19 has the support of well over
100 countries, <u><a href="https://ourworldisnotforsale.net/2021-04-14_PVA-letter">numerous

<p>Below
are multiple quotes from civil society organizations about the Walker
process and the TRIPS waiver. 

<p><i><b>Professor
Jane Kelsey, University of Auckland New Zealand:</b></i><i><b>&nbsp;</b></i>“New
Zealand’s Ambassador David Walker is facilitating a broader
Covid-19 recovery plan that has become skewed towards the interests
of richer countries, especially the “Ottawa Group” that includes
New Zealand. Reports from Geneva show the so-called “Walker
process” has become a Trojan Horse to introduce a raft of new
obligations through the back door. Least-developed and developing
countries, and their priorities, have effectively been excluded.”
<p>&nbsp;
<p><i><b>Sangeeta
Shashikant, Third World Network:</b></i><i><b>&nbsp;</b></i>&quot;Without
a meaningful TRIPS waiver there cannot be a meaningful WTO response
to the pandemic. This is recognized and reiterated by a broad base of
WTO developing and least developed Members but their calls have been
repeatedly ignored. Instead, Ambassador Walker set up a process that
keeps the majority of WTO Members outside the negotiation room and is
using multiple pressure tactics to push through his agenda and that
of countries that want to use the pandemic to repackage old
liberalization and deregulatory wishes. Their attempts to set up a
future work plan and new body on the WTO response to the pandemic,
based on the same premises, is only promising more of these tactics
to continue post the 12th&nbsp;Ministerial Conference and could in
effect bring an end to any remaining hopes that the WTO could deliver
to developing countries and LDCs on any developmental elements, such
as in agriculture and special and differential treatment, promised
back in 2001 (i.e. WTO Doha Development Agenda).&quot;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><i><b>Ann
Harrison, Senior Advocate, Amnesty International</b></i>&nbsp;“It
is deeply disturbing that the proposed&nbsp;text&nbsp;unilaterally
tabled by Ambassador Walker of New Zealand on WTO response to the
COVID-19 pandemic does not address the proposed temporary TRIPS
waiver proposed by India and South Africa and supported by over 100
WTO members. No credible WTO response to ending the pandemic can
exclude the immediate agreement to the proposed waiver.&nbsp;Had the
waiver been agreed when it was first introduced over a year ago,
additional manufacturing capacity for critical Covid-19 tools would
now be in place. WTO members should not allow themselves to be
distracted by the ‘Walker Process’, which will not fulfil states’
human rights obligations in relation to ensuring human rights through
international cooperation and assistance, including the rights to
life, health, and non-discrimination.&nbsp; Instead, we call for
those states blocking the TRIPS waiver – notably the European
Commission, the UK, Norway and Switzerland – to drop their
opposition and to allow the waiver to be agreed.&nbsp; As has been
demonstrated in a recent&nbsp;<u><a href="https://www.icj.org/global-jurists-call-for-waiver-of-global-intellectual-property-rights-for-covid-19-vaccines-and-therapeutics/" target="https://www.icj.org/global-jurists-call-for-waiver-of-global-intellectual-property-rights-for-covid-19-vaccines-and-therapeutics/">legal
opinion</a></u>&nbsp;endorsed by
our Secretary General, states that are party to the ICESCR must not
oppose the waiver in order to comply with their human rights
obligations.”
<p>
&nbsp;
<p><i><b>Baone
Twala, Legal Researcher, SECTION27, South Africa:</b></i>&nbsp;“The
Walker Process undermines developing countries’ right to access
Covid-19 vaccines. Conversely, the TRIPS Waiver seeks to realise this
right.”
<p>&nbsp;
<p><i><b>Jaume
Vidal,</b></i><i><b>&nbsp;</b></i><i><b>Senior
policy advisor European Projects Team,&nbsp; Health Action
International:</b></i>
<p>“The
so-called Walker process is but another attempt by a few countries to
push their own agendas, needs and goals under guise of consensus.&nbsp;
It is difficult to comprehend how a multilateral response to the
current pandemic does not include&nbsp; a reference to the need to
curb the excesses of IP enforcement, especially on health goods. The
support around a TRIPS waiver clearly demonstrates what is the
opinion of WTO members on the issue.”
<p>&nbsp;
<p><i><b>Lori
Wallach, Director of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch</b></i>:
“In the rich history of cynical WTO efforts to evade accountability
for the damage WTO rules have wrought, this effort by the few
countries that oppose a WTO waiver to issue a “Trade and Health”
Declaration is especially disgusting given this would not improve
access to the medicines needed to end the pandemic, and instead is
about trying to cover up the grim reality that WTO rules are
prolonging death and economic devastation. Time has long passed for
WTO declarations about trade and health, the cynical misdirect of the
so-called “Walker Process,” or any other attempted PR stunts
aimed at protecting the WTO’s reputation rather than saving lives
and ending the pandemic.”
<p><i><b>Max
Lawson co-Chair of the People's Vaccine Alliance, an international
coalition working to end the pandemic:</b></i><b>
 </b>The
Walker process is a sham: one that shows the WTO is allowing itself
to be held hostage by Germany and EU. It is unconscionable that even
after 17 million people have died from Covid-19, the WTO is still
beholden to big pharma monopolies - instead of driving home the
delivery of the comprehensive TRIPS waiver that the majority of its
members' demand.
<p>&nbsp;
<p><i><b>Arthur
Stamoulis, the executive director of Citizens Trade Campaign</b></i><b>,
a U.S.-based coalition of labor, environmental, family farm, faith
and consumer organizations: &nbsp;</b>
<p>&quot;The
world desperately needs the WTO to waive intellectual property rules
that continue standing in the way of increased production of the
COVID vaccines, test kits and treatments needed to save lives and end
the pandemic. &nbsp;After more than a year of debate, any WTO
response to COVID that fails to deliver a comprehensive waiver
agreement would call into question not only the point of holding a
ministerial in the middle of a public health emergency, but also the
credibility of the entire institution.”
<p>&nbsp;
<p><i><b>George
M. Carter, Director, the Foundation for Integrative AIDS
Research:</b></i><i><b>&nbsp;</b></i>“COVID
is not over. We want it to be in order to freely and safely open up
economies, schools and make work safe. But typically, the WTO and
their fake Walker Resolution seems only to be to open up more profits
for those who do not deserve them. A few companies and their
executives hold “their” intellectual property to profiteer at the
expense of millions of lives around the world. While President Biden
has made a tepid call for the TRIPS waiver that would indeed free the
vaccines complete recipes, allow for more manufacturing and help to
END the pandemic, he has done nothing to press this issue. The WTO,
the “Walker” process, the EU and the failure of the United States
to actually manage this one small demand, for publicly funded
vaccines, places us all in dire jeopardy. We need publicly available
treatments, testing and vaccines. &nbsp;Why is the greed of pharma’s
executives held sacrosanct while the lives of millions always of no
value?”

There is a very anti-development text on the table in fisheries subsidies, and the agriculture outcomes will likely do little to address global food security while punting serious reforms off into the future.
<p>
Perhaps most existentially, developed countries are pushing a “WTO reform” agenda that threatens the very basis of the WTO – multilateralism and consensus – in favor of plurilaterals, differentiation among developing countries, and an even more direct role and power for corporations – expanding the failed WTO model rather than transforming it.
<p>
Join us to hear from communities who will be directly affected by the outcome of the WTO’s negotiations this week, but have been sidelined by the WTO, in an effort to keep the illegal Green Rooms and anti-development negotiations out of the light of day.
  <p>

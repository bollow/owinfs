<p><b>September 15, 2021</b>
<p>The fifteenth session of the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) will be held
from October 3 to 7, 2021. UNCTAD plays an important role in the UN
system with a focus on developing country priorities and the nexus
between trade, development, finance, and technology. This Conference
will negotiate and establish the mandate for UNCTAD’s work over the
next four years at a crucial time when the world and particularly
developing countries face interconnected economic, health,
environmental, and social crises.
<p>Civil society has been repeatedly
blocked from contributing actively throughout the process of the
negotiations towards the UNCTAD XV mandate. Although many paragraphs
are agreed as of the latest publicly available text, there are many
key areas of the text still under consideration, for which the
expertise and perspectives of civil society must be heard.
<p>First, the text does not in any way
measure up to the current and interconnected economic, health, social
and environmental crisis that developing countries are facing.
Throughout the text, it is clear that Group B countries, particularly
those represented by the European Commission, were largely successful
in blocking any recognition of the direct responsibility of developed
countries (and the global institutions that they dominate) in
creating the debt crisis, the climate emergency and environmental
crisis, or the damage that their trade, investment, climate and
financial policies and practices have wrought on developing
countries. The entire narrative is one of the benefits of these
systems not being evenly shared, because developing countries lack
the capacity to achieve them. Under this false narrative, the
solution is for UNCTAD to assist developing countries to adjust more
to take advantage of the benefits trade, investment, digitalization.
Of course, if the origin of the problems of today’s world are not
accurately assessed, then the “solutions” will not resolve these
crises.
<p>The current draft UNCTAD text does not
strengthen the work of UNCTAD on finance, debt, South-South
cooperation, Palestine, and much more; and in some areas, such as on
some trade and investment issues, it goes in the wrong direction. If
concluded as anticipated, it will not advance the development agenda
from Nairobi, despite the heightened pressures on developing
countries arising from Covid 19, heightened debt distress and reduced
fiscal space. As things stand, these pressures rule out any hope of
achieving the Agenda 2030 in the vast majority of developing
countries.
<p>With regards to the <b>management of
UNCTAD </b>overall, the latest Chair’s test in orange in paragraph
95 speaks to the importance of UNCTAD’s role. Paragraphs 95.bis and
95.bis.primus are transparent efforts by the EU to micromanage the
institution to their liking and should have no place in the document.
With regards to the <b>role of UNCTAD overall</b>, references in the
text to “avoiding duplication” with other agencies should be
removed, as: UNCTAD’s work on many issues pre-dates that of other
institutions, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO); UNCTAD’s
work on issues such as debt have been mandated by Member states for
decades; and UNCTAD’s work represents a development-centered
approach rather than, for instance, a lender-based approach as in the
IFIs, and thus represent an important contribution to the global
debates.
<p>The consensus-building and technical
cooperation pillars of UNCTAD must be based on the outcomes and
evidence identified by the <b>analysis and research pillar</b>.
Paragraph 96.bis.primus is a naked attempt to censor, <i>a priori</i>,
the independence of the analytical pillar. This paragraph must be
removed for the institution to function according to its mandate.
Rather, it is the policy recommendations of the other pillars which
should be subject to review as to whether they are coherent with the
outcomes of research and analysis, to ensure they are evidence-based.
The work of UNCTAD to support <b>South-South cooperation</b> should
be strengthened.
<p>On <b>trade</b>, the texts fails to
acknowledge the single most important issue facing developing
countries in the current crisis: that of vaccine apartheid.
Intellectual property barriers on vaccines, as well as treatments and
diagnostics, enforced by the WTO are the single biggest cause of harm
to developing countries, in addition to severely constraining their
ability to use trade for development. The current multilateral system
constrains, rather than facilitates, countries’ ability to create
jobs, protect environmental sustainability, and ensure food security
and financial stability, and must thus be transformed. Rather than
lauding the WTO (an institution with liberalization, not development,
at its center) and calling for its expansion,  the document should
call for UNCTAD work across all three pillars to: 1. Assess the
asymmetries and imbalances in the rules multilateral system which
constrain the ability of developing countries to use trade for their
development, and provide technical cooperation and build consensus
towards ameliorating them; 2. Strengthen Special and Differential
Treatment (SDT) provisions, including within the Fisheries
negotiations in the WTO; 3. Work towards concluding the development
agenda; 4. Remove barriers to achieving food security including
through public stockholding provisions; 5. Condemn unilateral
coercive measures and work for their removal under international law;
6. Assess critically the impacts on trade and development of various
bilateral and regional agreements, rather than praising them
uncritically; and 7. Work to support developing countries in their
structural transformation, including through the removal of barriers
to the implementation of industrial policy; 8. Call for an immediate
agreement to the TRIPS waiver proposal so that barriers to trade in
under the rubric of intellectual property can be removed to end the
pandemic for all; 9. Work to reduce economic concentration.
<p>On <b>technology and the digital
divide</b>, it is not only increasing access to technology but the
digital economic divide, as demonstrated by UNCTAD’s research, that
must be addressed. Efforts to utilize UNCTAD in the service of an
agenda of digital behemoths based in developed countries is
deplorable and must be halted. All governments need the policy space
to pursue digital industrialization to create jobs and spur
innovation in the digital age, free of the pernicious impacts of
economic monopoly and concentration. They also need policy space to
manage the governance of data in the public interest, such as in the
strengthening of quality public services which are essential for
development and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs). Thus, 1. References to “data flows with trust” should be
excised; 2. ‘Multistakeholder approach’ is a code word for
corporate driven policy making and this term should be removed; 3.
UNCTAD’s mandate should include work across all three pillars on
digital industrialization, the value of data for developing countries
and its use and governance in the public interest, and ensuring
shared prosperity including by reducing economic concentration.  

<p>On <b>the climate emergency and
environmental crisis</b>, the text fails to recognize the
overwhelming responsibility of developed countries in causation and
falls short in a number of critical areas, including by attempting to
limit the work of UNCTAD to specific groups of countries when all
developing countries are affected. Thus, 1. When international
instruments are mentioned, those that are most crucial to developing
countries should be included; 2. The well-established underlying
principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibility (CBDR) must be
affirmed; 3. With regards to references to climate finance,
adjustment, and mitigation efforts, all developing countries and not
just LDCs, LLDCs, SIDS must be referenced; 4. The efforts to support
a transition to a just, sustainable and fully inclusive economy, such
as UNCTAD’s work to promote a global green new deal, must be
strengthened; 5. Technology Transfer must be emphasized as a solution
which UNCTAD’s three pillars should be mobilized to accelerate; 6.
The potential impacts of climate-related tariffs on developing
countries should be studied. 

<p>On <b>Palestine</b>, UNCTAD’s work in
this area must be strengthened.
<p>On matters of <b>taxation</b>, the text
does not measure up to the current global debates on the problem of
illicit financial flows and transnational corporations which
increasingly utilize digitalization to not only evade but avoid
paying taxes, which greatly affects developing countries’
development prospects. In this regard, the text should include Para
22 of <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/financing/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.financing/files/2021-04/E-FFDF-2021-L1_0.pdf"><u>2021
FfD outcome document</u></a> which acknowledged<i> </i>that
<i>“any consideration of tax measures in response to the digital
economy should include a careful analysis of the implications for
developing countries, taking into account their inputs, with a
special focus on their unique needs and capacities</i>”. We support
the input from G77 on the lack of a global inclusive
intergovernmental tax body and continue to call on governments to
support the long-standing G77 proposal to establish a universal,
intergovernmental tax body at the UN. We do not support inclusion or
reference to work by FATF and OECD in the text as they are exclusive
membership bodies that do not represent developing country interests.
Inclusion of ‘tax avoidance’, in addition to tax evasion, is
crucial as the central challenge for international cooperation on tax
matters remains the issue of tax avoidance by multinational
corporations. 

<p>​
<p>On <b>Finance for Development (FfD) and
Debt issues</b>, it cannot be underestimated how important the Role
of UNCTAD is in these areas. After the deletion of Paragraphs 71-76,
little analysis of debt issues and their structural causes remain
here. The analysis section should reference: the critical role of
UNCTAD in the UN system on debt issues; the need for a multilateral
sovereign debt workout mechanism building on the UN General Assembly
resolutions 68/304 and 69/319; the growing reliance on riskier and
short-term international financial markets for lack of appropriate
access to low-cost/concessional public lending; the need for
substantive debt cancellation (not just partial debt standstills),
including MICs; development-oriented long-term debt sustainability
analysis and frameworks for policy design; the problematic role of
private credit rating agencies and non-cooperative bondholders and
growing incentives for sovereign debt litigation. These should be
placed more explicitly in the context of the Covid-19 crisis,
aggravating already unsustainable debt burdens in developing
countries. Vulnerability and debt issues are “major global
challenges” which arise from structural flaws in the international
financial architecture and require multilateral solutions. In this
context, the role of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on FfD
should be strengthened as it has proven highly participatory and
beneficial.
<p>In addition, in the Role of UNCTAD
section on FfD must absolutely be strengthened, including work across
all three pillars to: 1. Strengthen its work in measuring and
combating illicit financial flows; 2. Strengthen UNCTAD’s
analytical and policy advice work on new creditor-independent
frameworks for debt sustainability analysis (with a view to
compatibility of this with long-term development goals) and on
reforms of the international financial architecture, including
sovereign debt architecture; 3. Strengthen its technical cooperation
on debt issues in particular through its Debt Management and
Financial Analysis (DMFAS) Programme; 4. Strengthen work on
vulnerability by including environmental and economic vulnerability
as relevant criteria; 5. Provide policy options for the reform of the
international financial and debt architecture in order to improve its
effectiveness in resolving developing country debt sustainability
issues.

This document conveys the collective positions of a large number of
civil society organizations and networks that engage with UNCTAD in
the various domains of its mandate, including trade, investment,
technology, structural transformation and climate transition, and
financing for development, among others. We look forward to engaging
with country delegates to ensure that these essential changes are
brought on board.

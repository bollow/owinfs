<p>A
dangerous corporate agenda is behind the effort to have new rules
limiting domestic regulation of services, within the General
Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) of the WTO. Some countries
announced a “plurilateral” agreement to handcuff domestic
regulation of services in the WTO in December 2021 that breaches the
WTO’s own rules. They aim to implement this agreement by 2023 by
having countries notify the WTO that they intend to adhere to it.
This is not the only
breakaway plurilateral negotiation. Several others, involving
electronic commerce and investment facilitation, were launched around
the same time but are not finished. So, if this is allowed to
succeed, it will set a very bad precedent for similar rulemaking on
almost any topic those powerful states want to call “trade”. 

<p>This
agreement, on “Domestic Regulation” (DR), would restrict the
types of rules that governments can make even if those rules are
applied the same to foreign and domestic companies. They would even
apply to <i>domestic</i> (non-traded) services (like construction) as
well as services that are traded (like air travel). The proposed
rules would apply to private companies as well as to public services
not covered by the narrow public services exception. 

<p>Proponents
argue that the “right to regulate” would still be safeguarded,
but the WTO has ruled that “Members’ regulatory sovereignty is an
essential pillar of the progressive liberalization of trade in
services, but this sovereignty ends whenever rights of other Members
under the GATS are impaired.” So, the “right to regulate” ends
where the WTO rules begin.  

<p>

<ul>
	<li>If these rules
	are brought in under the GATS, national governments will have to
	take such “reasonable measures as may be available” to ensure
	that regional and local governments and authorities observe them.
	So, they would apply to all levels of government, but the national
	government would not have to “force” provincial and local
	governments to comply on issues where the provinces and local
	governments have legal autonomy. 
	
	<li>The rules would
	only apply to service sectors that a country has committed to
	liberalise under the GATS.
	<li>These rules
	would apply to <i>existing</i> laws and regulations and how they are
	administered, as well as new ones in the future! 
	
</ul>
<p><b>What
are the types of regulations that would be disciplined by the
proposed new rules?</b>
<ul>
	<li><b>Qualification
	requirements and procedures</b> for professional services providers.
	These are the requirements that professional need to obtain to
	provide a service, such as a requirement that a doctor must have a
	medical degree and take exams in order to have qualify to practice,
	and the procedures to obtain the qualification. 
	
	<li><b>Licensing
	requirements and procedures</b> for companies and individuals. These
	involve the requirements they must meet in order to obtain a license
	to provide a service, for example the amount of capital a bank must
	have or requirements to do environmental impact assessments before
	opening a mine or conditions a lawyer must satisfy to get a
	practising certificate.
	<li><b>Technical
	standards</b>. These are the standards that must be complied with in
	the provision of a service. This would involve, for example, how
	clean the water must be that is supplied by the water company; the
	safety procedures in nuclear power stations; nurse to patient ratios
	in hospitals; etcetera. 
	
</ul>
<p><b>Why
is this being called a lobbyists charter?</b>
<ul>
	<li>The most
	important gain for the transnational corporations is the right to
	comment on proposed new laws and regulations that affect that affect
	licensing requirements and procedures, qualification requirements
	and technical standards <b>before they are adopted</b>.
	<li>They have to
	provide a “reasonable opportunity” to comment, must consider the
	comments they receive and are supposed to explain the purpose and
	reasoning behind the final version.
	<li>Governments are
	also “encouraged” to seek comments before they adopt procedures
	and administrative rulings as well.
	<li>This guarantee
	applies to foreign governments and well as the corporations of any
	country that has also adopted this agreement.
	<li>Many countries
	don’t provide this right to their citizens, so this would give
	foreign corporations and governments privileged rights to influence
	a country’s laws; even where that right does exist for citizens,
	the lobby power and pressure from corporations and governments will
	give them influence.
	<li>When
	governments are adopting technical standards that are developed
	through similar processes, including standards developed in
	international organisations like the various United Nations or
	professional bodies.
</ul>
<p><b>How
would the proposed DR negotiations interact with the proposals on
e-commerce and the digital economy? </b>

<ul>
	<li>These rules
	apply whether the service is provided in the country or across the
	border, especially by Internet. The digital economy poses huge new
	challenges for governments to regulate in response to: abuse of
	dominant market power by the biggest digital companies; their
	advantage of benefiting from first mover network effects and
	economies of scale; the fact that they own the latest technologies
	to process big data; the disruptions to traditional suppliers posed
	by platforms; the automation of production and services which the
	world is only now seeing begin. Governments will try to deal with
	this through licensing and technical standards. Big Tech already
	spends more than any other corporates on political lobbying so it
	will use the guaranteed right to lobby on new laws, regulations and
	procedures to the absolute max. 
	
</ul>
<p><b>The
rules also restrict the ways that governments decide whether their
requirements are met.  </b>

<ul>
	<li>When a
	corporate or individual needs authorisation to deliver a service
	they will need to prove they meet the necessary requirements and
	standards. Often governments try to ensure they have enough
	flexibility to decide whether an applicant meets the objectives
	behind the requirements. These rules say the criteria that
	governments use must be “objective” and “transparent”, which
	means no discretion or generalised terms.  
	
	<li>The rule says
	the government’s criteria can include health or environmental
	requirements, but they still need to meet that test. It doesn’t
	refer to culture, employment, development, or human rights
	requirements.
	<li>Procedures for
	authorising corporations or individuals to provide a service must be
	“impartial”. If the state were to put more emphasis on
	investigating offshore providers they are not familiar with they
	could be accused of being not “impartial!” 
	
	<li>Considerable
	burdens would be placed on the regulatory authorities in the
	administration of the above measures, such as providing a single
	window for applicants; meeting timeframes; accepting electronic
	applications and documents; providing information online; keeping
	applicants informed, responding to their queries and helping them
	re-apply, if rejected, etcetera.  
	
	<li>Authorisations
	that are granted must take effect without undue delay (subject to
	its terms and conditions). This means if the government changes its
	mind due to new information, a new political party coming to power,
	or a referendum etc, the licence (eg for a nuclear power station)
	must still take effect without delay. 
	
</ul>
<p><b>How
can this agreement affect government revenue?</b>
<p>The
fees that governments may charge for granting authorisation to
deliver a service must be “<b>reasonable</b>” and “<b>not
restrict the supply of the service</b>.”
<ul>
	<li>What is
	“reasonable” is not just up to the government to decide. If
	challenged, whether a fee is reasonable could be decided by a panel
	of foreign trade lawyers.
	<li>In some
	countries fees for licenses and permits are an important source of
	revenue. Some local governments may rely heavily on that income, for
	example to pay for police and fire departments, health clinics,
	street lighting and rubbish collection. If they have to cut fees
	that the corporations have to pay, they will have to find another
	income source or cut the service.
			<li>
			Some governments use fees to dissuade activities they want to
			reduce, such as using high licensing fees for casinos to reduce
			gambling. 
			
			<li>
			It is unclear what “authorisation” fees will cover – for
			example, would they include a climate change levy. All we know is
			that fees for use of natural resources (such as mining/forestry),
			mandated contributions for universal service protection and
			auctions such as of 4G phone spectrum are excluded.
</ul>
<p><b>What
about development issues in the Domestic Regulation negotiations? </b>

<ul>
	<li>Quite a few
	developing countries want to ensure their services professionals can
	work offshore. That is known in the GATS as Mode 4, the movement of
	natural persons. The provision for development of “necessary” DR
	rules was initially meant to address that issue. However, that goal
	and the process to achieve it have been side-lined by developed
	countries through this breakaway negotiation. What was agreed in
	2021 highly imbalanced and is not in the interests of developing
	countries or in the public interest in any country. 
	
	<li>The costs and
	benefits for DR rules will depend on whether a Member is a services
	exporter facing various barriers entering others’ markets, or a
	net services importer. Most developing countries are net importers.
	They stand to lose more and will have to open their markets more
	with these new disciplines, than if they were net exporters. But the
	rules will also always benefit large services corporations to the
	detriment of the public interest. 
	
	<li>The African
	Group has noted that the DR negotiations prioritized “the right to
	regulate and the interlinkages between regulations and broader
	domestic economic imperatives” and that the current proposals
	“would significantly constrain African Members' right to regulate
	for legitimate public policy objectives.”
</ul>
<p><b>What
is the state of play in the Domestic Regulation negotiations in the
WTO as of 2022? </b>

<ul>
	<li>Signatories to
	the Reference Paper on Domestic Regulation in 2021 include: Albania,
	Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China,
	Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, European Union, Hong Kong, China,
	Iceland, Israel, Japan, Kazakhstan, Liechtenstein, Mauritius,
	Mexico, Moldova, Montenegro, New Zealand, Nigeria, North Macedonia,
	Norway, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Russian Federation, Saudi
	Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand,
	Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay.
	<li>Almost
	all of the African Group, a few Latin American and Asian countries
	have steadfastly opposed the conclusion of the negotiations.
	<li>Any countries
	not on the above list are likely being actively pressured to join. 
	
	<li>Countries
	signal their adherence to the rules by sending a notification to the
	WTO to that effect. But even if their names were on it last year,
	they must consult domestically – let’s make sure they do not
	agree to such rules in the WTO!

Global agricultural production and trade, though relatively stable during the pandemic, are soon expected to be severely impacted. FAO has pointed towards the threats to food security, livelihoods and incomes and the need for corrective financial & trade policies. Key outstanding issues are on the table as we go towards the 12th Ministerial Conference. There are also new recommendations from 2020 suggesting an open trade regime. However, addressing the real needs of the pandemic necessitates a methodical assessment of the current needs vis a vis the current negotiations, mapping of the range of Member Statesâ€™ positions and designing a responsive architecture for agriculture. The Working Session will explore; how MC12 can address the additional challenges posed by the pandemic, and what a reshaped agricultural trade agreement or negotiations spanning outstanding issues on the table along with newer solutions could look like, and what will be its key elements and principles.

Even before COVID-19, e-commerce was already the most important engine of world trade. A few
countries and companies, however, have garnered the lion’s share of benefits from this ongoing
process - especially the US and China and their digital platforms. The COVID crisis has not changedthis undesirable development, and may possibly accelerate it. At the same time, trade talks are
ongoing at the WTO towards a plurilateral agreement on e-commerce. While transnational
corporations are calling for a free flow of data, India, South Africa and some other developing
countries, and even the EU, seek to establish data sovereignty. They are presenting new policies in
this regard, including with data localisation requirements. Does there exist an in-between solution
that would be best for developing countries? How should digital trade and data laws be designed for
inclusion and poverty reduction? What could be WTO’s role in achieving this goal?

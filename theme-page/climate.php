Some WTO members are negotiating plurilateral agreements under the rubric of “trade and environment.” However, these initiatives are not in line with multilaterally-agreed principles from the UNFCCC such as Common But Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR) and in fact would restrict the ability of many countries to address climate change domestically. In addition, they do not focus on what has been developing countries’ primary demands regarding climate change: for expanded rights to technology transfer for climate-related technologies.
<p>
Many of these initiatives represent a brazen attempt to pry open developing country markets for developed country exports by calling them “environmental” goods or services. At the same time, while blocking increased flexibilities for developing countries, developed countries are pushing for expanded flexibilities for themselves to use WTO-illegal unilateral measures, such as are included in the Carbon Border Adjustment Measures (CBAMs) of the EU, and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of the United States.
<p>
With the inappropriate support of the WTO Secretariat and without a multilateral mandate, a few initiatives are being taken by some members on trade and environment issues. These include the: Trade and Environmental Sustainability Structured Discussions (TESSD); Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reform; an Agreement on Climate Change, Trade and Sustainability (ACCTS) and the Informal Dialogue on Plastics Pollution and Environmentally Sustainable Plastics Trade (IDP).

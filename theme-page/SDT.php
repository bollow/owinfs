Members of the WTO enjoy wildly different levels of development and advantages in global trade. Different rules benefit countries at various levels of development differently. Thus, at the time of the founding of the WTO, in recognition of this reality, developing countries advocated for flexibilities from the rules, because they realized that they would benefit developed economies but not developing economies. These rules are often called “Special and Differential Treatment (SDT) in the WTO. Otherwise, developing countries never would have agreed to the  existence of the WTO and its hyperglobalized, pro-corporate rules which prioritize corporations’ “rights” to trade over national economic goals such as development. 
<p>
Nevertheless, powerful rich countries ensured that WTO rules were skewed in their favor. Since the founding of the WTO, developing countries set forth a series of more than 100 proposals to address difficulties they had in implementing WTO rules that constrained their ability to develop their economies. Many of these “Implementation Issues” were included in the Doha Development Round in 2001, which rich countries claimed would focus on these development issues. Developing countries would never have agreed to launch a new round without these assurances. 
<p>
Since that time, developed countries have actually refused to agree to a single demand by developing countries within the Development Agenda. Rich countries have blocked any progress on the mandate within the development agenda to strengthen SDT in the WTO. Strengthening SDT would reduce the onerous incursion into domestic policy-making that developing countries opposed and can be interpreted as reducing the power of the WTO over their economies. Current SDT proposals by the G90 group of over 100 developing countries include issues such as:
<ul class="tail">
  <li>allowing more flexibilities in trade-related investment measures (TRIMs) so that developing countries could foment industrial policies (such as targeted subsidies and local content requirements);
  <li>allowing Least Developed Countries (LDCs) flexibility from TRIPS and TRIMS rules as long as they are LDCs; 
  <li>ensuring that Duty Free Quota Free (DFQF) applies to 100 percent of exports by LDCs; 
  <li>not forcing additional commitments from LDCs in their processes of acceding to the WTO; 
  <li>ensuring that food security is paramount in guiding ongoing and future trade negotiations;
  <li>removing limitations on the movement of persons and facilitating process of recognition of qualifications in services rules; 
  <li>allowing more tools to combat trade mispricing which allows for tax fraud by TNCs; and many more. 
</ul>
<p>
These are in addition to proposals in any particular theme, such as demands for flexibilities from TRIPS monopoly rules during the Covid-19 pandemic; ensuring development in the fisheries subsidies negotiations; transforming agricultural negotiations to ensure fairness; etc. 
<p>
Unfortunately, in recent years, not only have developed countries opposed changes to existing WTO rules to make them more flexible for development, they are also engaging in an assault to weaken the existing SDT flexibilities, under the guise of WTO reform. These proposals include: 
<ul class="tail">
  <li>trying to force developing countries to negotiate flexibilities on a case-by-case basis, abolishing the solidarity and benefits of collective bargaining to developing countries; 
  <li>creating onerous new requirements on transparency and notification; 
  <li>imposing new restrictions on companies they deem as state-trading enterprises; and 
  <li>limiting the number of developing countries that can avail themselves of the SDT flexibilities to arbitrary invented criteria, among others.
</ul>
Civil society has long called for the transformation of the current global rules. Many civil society demands align with the development agenda of strengthening SDT.

<div class="searchable">
<p>
Current demands of OWINFS with regards to Policy Space for Development include:
<ul class="tail">
  <li>A strong package of proposals for policy space for development, known as the Special and Differential Treatment agenda, must be re-centered as the main focus in the WTO and agreed to immediately. 
  <li>Attempts to prevent developing countries from accessing rights and flexibilities in the WTO through “differentiation” must be abandoned.
  <li>The expansion of binding commitments to cut tariffs through the Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA) negotiations, the Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA), or the pressuring of countries to join the expanded Information Technology Agreement (ITA-II) must be abandoned.
  <li>Any agreement to limit subsidies in the Fisheries sector must not undermine sovereign rights already set out in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Any outcome must include a strong component of S&amp;DT provisions to ensure that developing countries can pursue sustainable development of their fishing sectors while the harmful subsidies of large industrial fleets must be disciplined.
  <li>The LDC package, including Duty-Free Quota-Free access for LDCs, a fair and immediate resolution to the demands of the cotton-producing countries, and a services waiver for LDCs, should be implemented immediately.
  <li>Proposals to increase administrative burdens of developing countries under the rubric of “transparency and notification” are wholly inappropriate and should be replaced with changes to make the institution function in a more transparent and democratic manner that is respectful of capacity constraints of member countries, including through not holding simultaneous meetings; ensuring that meetings properly documented and that interpretation is universally provided.  
  <li>If LDCs pursue accession into the WTO, their entry must not be conditioned on market access demands, but they should be able to accede on terms that allow them to use trade according to their development needs. These terms should not go beyond those applied to original LDC Members of the WTO. Countries that are “graduating” from LDC status should be provided flexibility to undertake new rules in ways that are compatible with their development trajectory.
  <li>A thorough assessment of existing constraints to countries’ ability to pursue domestic policies and use trade for development must be conducted so that rules across the WTO on intellectual property, agriculture, investment, services, and goods can then be transformed in accordance with structural transformation development policies.
</ul>

Various WTO Members submitted a Communication to the WTO in November 2018 which, if accepted, would affect the implementation of Members’ transparency and notification obligations at the WTO. It would strengthen the already burdensome notification obligations and introduce new punitive administrative measures should obligations not be complied with. This paper provides information about WTO Members’ current notification obligations and their level of compliance; looks at the history of discussions on notifications, particularly in the Working Group on Notification Obligations and Procedures which took place in 1995 – 1996; and provides an analysis of the Communication.
